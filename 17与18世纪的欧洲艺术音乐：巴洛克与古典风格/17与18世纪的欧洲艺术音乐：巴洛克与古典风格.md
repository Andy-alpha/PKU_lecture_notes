 “巴古”音乐
========

“巴洛克” 的首次出场是在贬义性语境下被用于评价 18 世纪的音乐作品(更具体 一点来说，该词是用来批判拉莫 (Jean-Philippe Rameau, 1683–1764) 于 1733 年创作的歌剧 《希波利特和阿里希》( *Hippolyte et Aricie* )，而非 17 世纪的作品。

“古典”则是19世纪的人指代上世纪的作曲家：海顿 (Joseph Haydn, 1732–1809)、莫扎特 (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, 1756–1791) 与贝多芬 (Ludwig van Beethoven, 1770–1827)。

将老巴赫 (J. S. Bach, 1685–1750) 视为 “巴洛克时期” 的终结者而忽略拉莫等人在巴赫逝世后维持具有 “巴洛克” 风格的创作也是不合理的。

再者，海顿与莫扎特曾被 19 世纪评论家 E. T. A. Hoffmann 认定为 “浪漫主义” 的先驱，这似乎也无法与 “古典时期的作曲家” 这个称号相互兼容。

“巴洛克风格” 作为统摄这些不同风格的主要审美参照点，因为 它们皆直指巴洛克风格中所共有的动态感与戏剧性两个根本特质。

之后会讲“海顿”，被史学家定义为 “前古典时期”。

数字低音 (*basso continuo*)的使用与“巴洛克时期重叠”

# The End of the Renaissance & the Concept of Baroque

第一首：文艺复兴的弥撒。纯人声，无乐器。Palestrina, *Missa Papae Marcelli* (1562), Dresdner Kammerchor

第二首：标准巴洛克，器乐地位重要 Antonio Vivaldi, "Summer" from *Four Seasons* (1723)

以画为例，《人间欢乐花园》中，最右边的地狱才听器乐曲

According to Manfred Fritz Bukofzer(1910-1955)：*MUSIC in the BAROQUE ERA*.

## Renaissance versus Baroque

| Renaissance                                                  | Baroque                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| One practice, one style（到此时期并非取代教堂风格，只是除了教堂风格的基础上还增加了其他的风格） | Two practices, three styles                                  |
| **Restraint** representation of the text（教会不注重表达歌词，强调乐音和谐好听） | **Afffective, even theatrical** representations of the text（这里隐含了两方面：音乐好听按规则写和歌词会有所冲突） |
| **Equal-voice** polyphony（每个声部都平等出力，标准复调手法） | Treble-bass polarity（高声部忙碌，低声部负责和声）           |
| Diatonic melody in a **small range**（最高音和最低音相距不大） | Diatonic/chromatic melody, **wide range**（最高音和最低音相距甚远） |
| Modal counterpoint（对位法）                                 | Tonal counterpoint (1670s-1680s)（调性）                     |
| Intervallic（横向地写作，追求一行内音高的和谐）              | Chordal（垂直式，先有和弦，再确定音高）                      |
| No pronunced differences of idiom: voices and instruments are largely interchanges（声乐作品和器乐作品可以互换，William Byrd） | Vocal and instrumental idioms are often distinct（不能轻易改编） |

## The Concept of the "Baroque"

Barroco (Portuguese): an irregularly-shaped pearl

作为一个审美概念，要到18世纪。而且最早是用在建筑上的。作为音乐上，是1733年用于侮辱Rameau的歌剧《希波利特和阿里希》( *Hippolyte et Aricie* ）

无论称为什么时期，1600至1750不同音乐体裁之间的风格仍然有共性。

有些学者称为Early Modern Period (secular thoughts and secular art)，文化上从教堂向世俗演变。

还有人称为Orchestral age/Theatrical age，因为管弦乐在其中广泛使用，还常演戏剧，不过没什么人用此说法。

In retrospace (1920s to the present): works of music and art from the "Baroque" period possess the positive attributes of **drama, theatricality, passion** and **extravagance**. 

## Continuo age (the use of Basso continuo, figured bass)

使用数字低音/通奏低音/持续低音的时期。基本用的是harpsichord（羽管键琴）伴奏，同时作曲家往往只写根音，键盘手自己补全所有的和弦。为什么是数字呢？在乐谱中有些非一般三和弦的，会有额外数字标示音程差几度。

Violone, 维奥尔琴，虽然长得像大提琴，但是最多可以有8弦，还有品格。可以和harpsichord合奏。

Lute. （鲁特琴），可以取代羽管键琴

**Basso continuo** is a form of musical accompaniment used in the Baroque period. It means "continuous bass." Basso continuo, sometimes just "continuo", was played by an instrument providing **chordal accompaniment** such as a keyboard instrument ofr plucked string instrument such as the lute along with another bass instrument such as cello, violone, or bassoon. **The keyboard instrument was normally a harpsichord but could also be an organ**, such as a small portative instrument. It was not usual to write out all the nots for the keyboard player. The composer normally just wrote the bass line which would be played by the left hand and indicated what the harmony should be (which chords should be played) by writing figures underneath the music.

例如Vampire Weekend, *Step*; The Beatles, *In My Life*中也有，70’s 有Baroque Pop风潮。

总结：重点是Basso Continuo、figure base、ground base。

## Aesthetic and Technical Connections

为什么当时会喜欢听？当时有雅典学院为了复古，创造了实验音乐（Experimental Music）。

1600年之所以被视为Baroque风格的起点，是大约在1590s左右出现了实验音乐，引领了风潮。这其实比文艺复兴更像文艺复兴，因为它试图直接复原（想像中的）古希腊的音乐。

Girolamo Mei，1519-1594认为古希腊悲剧音乐是单声部。Galilei支持其想法。

~~*Ars perfecta* (Perfect Music)~~，Galilei认为不好听，抛弃对位法(Sensuous adornments of counterpoint)，模仿自然，The Imitation of Nature

但是Galilei他反对~~Madrigalism~~（牧歌主义，指把文字里的内容用歌表达出来，例如Monteverdi, *Zefiro torna*），认为很简单粗暴。

他所模仿的是Human Speech, Natural Language，被称为极端人文主义（radical humanism）。他相信Music is an Art of Persuasion，*Stile rappresentativo* "representation style"（说服的艺术，这也是它相信的音乐的教化和美学作用），一开始仅指模仿人讲话的风格。当然后来很快又变了。

**Monody**（单声歌曲）：a single voice (taking from actual, enacted, enunciated speech accompanied by the lute)

事实上文艺复兴时期以前，也是有一个声音所唱的音乐Monophonic（单音音乐），不过没有乐器，而上面的定义中有伴奏。

对古代戏剧的研究，不能绕过以下这个婚礼。

*Intermedii*: <font color="red">Music perfomed between the acts of a spokeeen comedy</font> "One of the first practical demonstrations, or tests, of the new radical-humanist esthetic came in 1589, when Count Bard was asked to organize the entertainment for the wedding of the Grand Duke Ferdinando de' Medici（斐迪南一世·德·美第奇）of Tuscany to the Princess Christine of Lorraine（洛林的克莉斯汀）."

"<font color="red">Florence, 1589.</font> On the occasion of the rigning Grand Duke Ferdinando de' Medici's（斐迪南一世·德·美第奇）marriage to Christine of Lorraine（洛林的克莉斯汀）. <font color="red">It's one of the fundamental episodes in the theatre of the Ancient regime's history.</font> The perfomance was increasingly becoming an instrument to display the power and technical capacity of the lord and his court. Florence, the capital of the Grand Duchy, anticipated this synthesis of art and power. <font color="red">This period must be considered, due to the inventions and the technological advancements, and its resonance in all the European courts, as the acme of this experimentaion.</font>"

[http://www.artes-exhibition.digital/florence-1589/]

它少见地用了复调的手法，用的单声歌剧，请的牧歌主义的先锋者来表演。

"The *intermedii* became increasingly lavish and costly—a form of conspicuous meant to impress invited guests with their noble host's wealth and liberality. The height was reached at Medici family weddings, each success one striving hard at Medici family weddings, each success one striving hard to outdo the last… <font color="red">The 1589 nupital festivities for Ferdinand were the most lavish of the Medici extravaganzas…</font> The big concerned numbers were mainly the work of the great <font color="red">madrigalists</font>…"

两个人是重要的单声歌曲的改革者。

"Monodic Revolution", "Monodic Revolutionaries"

Giulio Caccini(卡契尼, ca. 1550-1618)，和Jacopo Peri（佩里，1561-1633）



下一首曲子，像人声念经Rappresentatione Recitativo, "prose recitation in singing" (connecting different arias)，这是爱复调的人坚持自己的追求，但融合了单声音乐的特点作出来的。



下面有两首Caccini作的曲子，第二首虽然叫《牧歌》，但非牧歌主义之作，而是人讲话声加伴奏。

1. Airs, strophic form
2. <font color="red">Madrigals (without madrigalism), through-composed form</font>

"There is speech, delivered at something close to **normal speech tempo and restricted to something like normal speech range**, the whole vocal part is confined to an ambitus of a ninth but really an octave since the high notes is reached only once, near the end—an obvious correlation of range with **rhetorical** emphasis."

**用到Basso Continuo的牧歌**，开始扩大影响。传统的复调在此时期继续流行。

"Begining in 1602, then, madrigals existed—and were available for purchase—in two forms. <u>Traditional polyphonic madrigals</u> remained popular; they continued to be published and reprinted until the 1630s. <u>Continuo madrigals</u> like Caccini's, and eventually "concerned" madrigals with instrumental parts, gradually gained on the older type, outstripping it in numbers of new publications in the 1620s."

慢慢，这种来源于婚礼幕间的音乐，走向了戏剧舞台。例如Dialogue

From *Intermedii* to *Arias, recitativo* to *Operas (Musical Tales)*，时代大约在1600年。

少数人不认为这是歌剧，不够丰富，所以后期加了舞台效果，动作等的，才是歌剧。

"The essential 'operatic' move, then, was the insistence that music function on two levels—as <font color="red">**representing music** and also as **representing speech**</font>—which meant that some of the music was coded one way for the characters on stage and another way for the audience. There was a music that both the audience and the stage characters 'heard' as music (the songs and dances) [<font color="red">phenomenal music</font>] and another music that the audience heard as music but that was 'inaudible' to the characters on stage who were represented as speaking. [<font color="red">noumental music</font>]"

# From Monteverdi's Madrigals to Monteverdi's Operas

## Monteverdi's Madrigals

Leo Schrade, *Monteverdi: creator of the modern Music*

Claudio Monteverdi 1567-1643

终其一生，出版了九册的牧歌，可见其热爱。

"By the time Monteverdi composed the *Lagrime d'amante* (*Lover's Tears*), even Monterverdi's polyphonic style had been touched by the monodic stile recitativo."

开始在Mantua(Màntova)，后来因工钱少，搬到威尼斯工作生活。

*Incenerite spoglie* ("Ashen Remains")  *Lagrime d'Amante al sepolcro dell'amata* ("A lover's tears at his beloved's grave", 1610 from the Sixth Book)

第六册中的曲子，体现了A capplla和stile recitativo的融合。在这以后，他不再写纯粹复调+声乐的组合了。

之后他尝试单声歌曲加上实验性效果

1. Unstaged monody
2. Music for staging in the theater of mind

*Lettera Amorosa* ("Love Letter"), is a monody from the Seventh Book (1619), the most extended one that Monteverdi ever conceived outside of an actual theatrical situation.

然后又走向了一定的牧歌主义的实验，比如 *Stile concitato* "agitated sytle".（激动风格）

里面表现了一男一女打架的情景，极具剧场效果。

可见，Monteverdi的风格多样。

接下来是第八本中的《仙女的悲叹》（复调风格）。这里用了下行四音音阶Lament, descending tetrachord (minor mode chaconne bass)，影响至贝多芬等一众人。

Lament是夏空/洽空（Chacona）的其中一种，即他开创了悲叹调的下行四音音阶。等于说在Basso continuo中听到了一种固定重复的低音音型

这相当于作曲家独立发明了一种语言，在他的最后一首歌里面也用了这种技巧。

"By the time of his accession to the post in 1601 [at Mantua] he had already published four books of madrigals and had already been famously attacked by a conservative music theorist name **Giovanni Maria Artusi**（阿图西） for harmonic liberties in madrigals that would eventually be published in his next book (1603). The controversy enhances his reputation enormously, especially when he joined in himself, first in the preface to his **Fifth Book** of Madrigals (1605). Two years later—in <font color="red">1607</font>, the year of *Orfeo*—Monteverdi fully responded to his critics."

> Texts (aesthetic arguments):
>
> 1. Giovanni Artusi, L’Artusi overo /delle imperfettioni della moderna musica (Venice, 1600)
> 2. Claudio Monteverdi, Preface to *Il quinto libro de madrigali a cinque voci* (Venice, 1605)
> 3. Giulio Cesare Monteverdi, “Dichiaratione” [“Declaration”], in Claudio Monteverdi, *Scherzi musicali a tre voci di Claudio si ritrova stampata nel quinto libro de suoi madrigali* (Venice, 1607)

Monteverdi提出了“第二实践”<font color="red">Seconda pratica</font> (the "second practice", *stile moderno*)，相对地，阿图西捍卫的“第一实践”<font color="red">Prima pratica</font> (the "first practice", *stile antico*)。

第二实践：希望文字不要成为音乐的奴隶。例如，为了歌词表达，必须引入一些不和谐的音程。当然，Monteverdi也不反对其他的路线。

| Renaissance                                    | Baroque                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| One practice, one style (church)，只有第一实践 | <font color="green">Two practice in parallel</font> (antico, moderno) three styles (church, chamber ,theater) |

**Word-Painting or “Madrigalisms”**

“… striking musical images, evoking the text almost literally”

1. Sound: breezes, sweet accents, murmuring, sweet sound, music, harmony, sonorous caves
2. Voice: weeping, singing, groaning, sighing, moaning, speaking, debating
3. Image: foot, wace, green leaves, flowers dancing, fields, heads garlanded, mountains and deep valleys, caves, the sun rising at dawn, golden radiance, light, silver, cerulean mantle, abandoned woods, fire of the eyes
4. Action: breezes animate a landscape, young women dance, sound echoes in caves, the sun rises and spreads its light; the speaker wanders alone through abandoned woods
5. Dramatic situation: the speaker is alone and tormented by thoughts of love, desire, and loss, even though the world beyond the abandoned woods is celebrating with song, dance, and a beautiful dawn

*Zefiro torna* *(Summer Breezes return*)

Dance: basso ostinato，固定低音或和弦不斷重複

其中chaconne (It., ciaccona, esp., chacona): lively dance imported into Italy from Latin America

## Monteverdi's Opera

In collaboration with Otravio Rinuccini（里努奇尼)and Jacopo Corsi, **Peri** is best known for composing what was probably the Greast opera (musical tale), *La Dafne* (《达芙妮》, 1598)，and also, in collaboration with Rinuccini, the fust opera for which complete music still exists, L’ Euridice(《尤厨狄著》, 1600)

Some recognize them as **Muscial Tales** rather than **Opera**. 直到1607年Monteverdi写作《奥菲欧》才算。

原因：

Monody: Solo song (often with a tone of lamentation) **Greek monodia**, from **monodia *singing alone***.

Chorus: comments on the action as it unfolds Greek **khoros**.

Dance: Choreographed movement and gesture (ritualistic).

### Monteverdi的写作模式的变化：

Monteverdi's two most famous theatrical pieces, sole survivors in the repertory of the court and market genres of seventeenth-century Italy, will make an ideal vantage point for observing them since they epitomized the two artistic and political poles:

从宫廷写作模式到商业写作模式。

Màntova-> Venice

《奥菲欧》*L’ Orfeo*->《波佩亚的加冕》

有将近40年的跨度。

早期歌剧极尽奢华，展现财力和权力。

"The early musical plays, of which Monteverdis Orfeo was the crowning stroke, are characterized as the capital artistic expression of the twin triumphs of political absolutism and economic mercantilism, an expression that brought to its pinnacle the traditional explorations of the arts 'as a means of representing power.'"

"Display of **splendor** was one of the main social functions of music for the
Counter Reformation and the baroque courts, made possible only through
money; and the more money spent, the more **powerful** was the representation. Consistent with the mercantile ideas of wealth, **sumptuousness** in the arts became actually an end in itself…However, viewed from the social angle theshining lights of the flooring arts cast the blackest of shadows. Hand in hand with the brilliant development of court and church music when the Inquisition and che ruthless exploitation of the lower classes by means of oppressive taxes."

Bukofzer

所以要有

- 多人
- 舞台、器乐、灯光
- 故事要讲宏大的神话，以便贵族们代入。所以体裁多是allegories。
- 不过，此时期还是反对甚至禁止VIRTUOSITY（炫技）的，觉得俗气。所以还是有单声歌曲的感觉。到了大众时期则不然。

1. The fusion of all che arts in the common entrprise of princely aggrandizement. The monster assemblages of singers and instrumentalists were marched, and even exceeded, by che luxuriously claborate stage sets and thearrical machinery.
2. The plots involved mythological or ancient historical heroes caught up in stereotyped conflicts of love and honor, were transparent allegories of the sponsoring rulers, who were address directly, as we know, in the obligatory prologues that linked the story of the opera to the cent of their reign.
3. The ban on virtuosity reflected the old aristocratic prejudice, inherited from Aristotle. (Caccini, moderate, intimate, clegantly applied throat-music called Borgia, comparable in some ways with the intimate style of singing known in the 20th century as crooning).

"In the myth, after losing Eurydice a second time, Orpheus turns against all women, for which reason a rioting chorus of jealous Bacchantes tears him to pieces. In the Orfeo libretto, Orpheus's facher Apollo, the divine musician, translates Orpheus into the heavenly constellation that bears his name, substituting serene apotheosis for bloody caraclysm."

键盘乐器：<font color="red">Toccata</font>，一般是迎接尊贵的人入场，所以声音听起来热闹高昂。

<font color="red">Toccata</font>, a quasi-military fanfare that, according to the published scorc, was to be played chree times from various places around the hall to silence the audience and invest the proceedings with appropriate pomp. The interest in ostentations displays of power that the Counter Reformation church shared with the ‘baroque’ courts' is nicely confumed by Monteverdi's reuse of the *Orfeo* toccata three years later in a very uncustomary way to back up the choral *falsobordone* (choral recitation) for he Invitatory (opening Psalm verse) in his Vespers of 1610 which, we recall, was originally intended for Rome, the Counter Reformation command center.

#### Commercial Music Theater

"In one of the most impressive feats of self-rejuvenation in the history of music, the septuagenarian Monteverdi, bestirred by the institution of public opera cheaters, or else offered teums he couldn't refuse, came out of retirement and composed a final trio of operas for the Teatro SS. Giovanni e Paolo, one of several competitors that quickly sprang up to challenge San Cassiano, the original opera house".


1643年，为庆祝歌剧院的落成，他又写了一部《波佩亚的加冕》。其内容变为

Historical Fantasy，历史演义

"For the grater enjoyment of the paying public" Poppea: celebrating vice triumph and mocking virtue.

剧情是邪恶最终战胜，好人被放逐。

"Noro, enamored of Poppaca, who was the wife of Otho, sent the latter, under the pretext of embassy, to Lusitania (Portugal], so that he could take his pleasure with her--this according to Cornelius Tacitus. ..Otho, desperate at seeing himself deprived of Poppaca, gives himself over to frenzy and exclamations. Octavia, wife of Nero, orders Otho to kill Poppaca. Otho promises to do it; but lacking the spirit to deprive his adored Poppaca of life, he dresses in the clothes of Drusilla, who was in love with him. Thus disguised, he enters the garden of Poppaca. Loe [the god Eros] disturbs and prevents that death. Nero repudiates Octavia, in spite of the counsel of [the philosopher] Seneca, and takes Poppaca to wife. Seneca is sentenced to death, and Octavia is expelled from Rome."

这里也用了Lament的下行四音阶，但用了大调，表现了他们爱情的明朗（和建立在他人的痛苦之上）和不顾道德的转换。

这里可以解释为：Lubricious major replaces the lamenting minor -> Subverting all moral and political codes

从此开始流行返始咏叹调：

### 返始咏叹调 (de capo aria, A B A 型)

唱完A、B段后回到A段。

> A: I gaze on you, I enjoy you.
> I hug you, I entwine you. No more pain, no more death.
> O my life, O my treasure.
>
> B: I am yours. I am yours,
> My joy, say you lose me too.
> You are truly my idol.
> Yes, my love, yes my heart, my life, yes.
>
> A: I gaze on you, I enjoy you.
> I hug you, I entwine you. No more pain, no more death.
> O my life, O my treasure.

Comic Scene
"Octavia's farewell to Rome as she boards the ship that is to take her into
exile, is followed immediarely by the most farcical—Arnalta's gloating at
her mistress's impending elevation, and her own."

1. 美声
2. 喜剧

学界认为，自从歌剧开始卖票、开始商业化之日，正是真正的歌剧出现之时。

"Not surprisingly, **virtuosity** found a natural home in the commercial music cheater. It is only one of the reasons for regarding the Venctian Teatro San Cassiano and the year of 1637, not the Florentine Palazzo Patti or the year 1597, as the true time and place of the birth of opcra as we know it now… From now on, the word opera will mean the commercial opera."

Seventeenth and eighteenth century serious opera is unthinkable without *castrati*（去势男高音、阉人歌手），才能唱出高声。

**Castrato** (plural: castrati)

提问：第一实践？巴洛克初期音乐风格？巴洛克中期音乐风格？

分别是

1. 文字屈服于音乐性，禁止引入不和谐音程。
2. 初期有了单声歌曲，模仿人声，但排斥牧歌主义。此时Basso continuo开始广泛使用。
3. 中期，第二实践为人们所接受，加之Monteverdi开创了Lament等，以及向歌剧开始演变，例如有了丰富的舞台效果。
4. （但是，传统的复调音乐并不是不存在了，在整个时期仍然有人在写作。）

# France Opera

The Spectacle of Power and Pleasure

Jean-Basptiste Lully and the *Tragédie en musique*（音乐悲剧）/*Tradédie lyrique*（抒情悲剧）

得易于路易十四推行的“法式大餐”的奢华风格。

Louis XIV

- Born in 1638, died in 1715
- Actively reigned from 1661 to 1715, although he became king in 1643, at nearly five years of age 
- Centrallized power through his court at Versailles, fashioned himself as an absolute monarchy
- Supported by the arms, including theater and opera, as entertainment and as a symbolic representation of his power.

Absolute Monarchy：君主专制

把自己称为“太阳王”，强调自己的神授的权力。

法国歌剧相比意大利克制，注重阶级和权威。

# The spectable of Power and Pleasure

Jean-Baptiste Lully and the *Tragédié en musique*（音乐悲剧）

*Tragédié lyrique*（抒情悲剧）

以下要讲的是法国的歌剧。因为要和意大利区分，所以命名上不一样。

Jean-Baptiste Lully（1632-1687），吕利，一开始担任意大利语私人家教。

后来进入了宫廷，和Louis XIV

**Dance and Political Control**:
"Dance reinforced the state by offering a model of discipline, order, refinement, restraint, and subordination of the individual to a common enterprise. Requiring aristocrats to participate in social dancing and in ballet performances kept them busy and provided a ritualized demonstration of social hierarchy, with the king at the top. It is no wonder that French Baroque Music, so centered on dance, is marked by refinement, elegance, and restraint, in strong contrast to the individuality and showmanship typical of Italian music at the time."

"Nowhere else in Europe had operas become classics, nor had any other composer of operas been exalted into a symbol not only of royal taste but of royal authority as well. **Authority** is what French music was all about, and Lully's operas above all. They were the courtiest court operas that ever were.

Lully, *Cadmus et Hermione*, 1673，旋律风格朴实克制，旋律向上。对比意大利歌剧，后者多飙高音，强调美声唱法。

## Political Debate

想要引入意大利歌剧时，有人为了维护法国文化的品味，强调区别。

French v.s Italian

| French      | Italian  |
| ----------- | -------- |
| Reason      | Pleasure |
| rules、克制 | 旋律大跳 |
|             |          |

Raguenet在1702年写了书，比较两种歌剧的异同。
Freach musicians believe themselves lost if they do the slightest thing contrary to the **rules**. They caress, tickle, respect the car and still [they] tremble with fear that they will not succeed even afer having done things as correctly as possible. **The Italians, more bold, suddenly change** the note and the mode and make double and redoubled trills of a 7 and 9 measures upon notes which we would not even believe suitable for the slightest trill. They hold notes of such a prodigious length that those who are not accustomed to them, first of all cannot help being offended by such boldness which subsequently they cannot seem to praise cough. They make such lengthy **melismas** that those hearing them for the first time become confused. (Raguenet 1702)

If one gives one of these dissonances to a Frenchman to sing, he will never have the force to sustain it fimly which [is what] it needs to make it successful. **His car being accustomed to the sweetest and the most natural consonances** is shocked by the irregularity. He trembles when singing it; he wavers. Whereas, the Italians whose cars are experienced since childhood with these dissonances and were therefore used to them by force of habit, are as firm on the most irregular note as on the world's loveliest chord and sing them all with a boldness and assurance which makes them always succced. (Raguenet, 1702)

## 歌剧在法国的发展

"Opera had a difficult time getting started in France. Like their English counterparts, who also possessed a glorious tradition of <font color="red">spoken theater (话剧)</font>, the aristocrats of seventeenth-century France sawr only a child's babble in what the Italians called drama per musica (drama 'through' or 'by means of' music). To their minds, <u>the art of music and the art of drama simply would not mix</u>. Artists and critics who value lintellectual understanding have always resisted opera.

一开始，认为削减了严肃性，面临强烈的反抗。

比如Jean Racine(让·拉辛，1639-1699)《费德尔》 1677，是传统的话剧，完全不适合改编成歌剧，所以有所冲撞。

在路易十四执政前，法国宫廷内部已经有模仿Orfeo产生的歌剧。也带有下行低音。

接下来，正式的法语歌剧出现。

Robert Cambert（康贝尔）、Pierre Perrin（佩兰, ca. 1620-1675）写作了Pomona（《波蒙纳》），1671，早在Lully前写出的。所以让他很不高兴。

意大利强调的华丽，在法国歌剧里有过之而无不及，希望把所有人吸入里面无法自拔。

"'The Italian spectacles... bedizened the French court more gloriously than any rationalistic drama could do, for the purpose of such spectacles.is to hold the mind, the eye and the ear equally in thrall.

小结：

On the one hand:

"Like every other aspect of French administrative culture, the French court opera was wholly centralized. Its primary purpose was to furnish propaganda' for the state and for the divine right of the king, and only secondarily to provide entertainment for the nobility and bourgeoisie. No operatic spectacle could be shown in public anywhere in France that had not been prescreened, and approved, at court."

## Dramaturgy（戏剧构作）

最后一部（成熟的风格）
*Rinaldo and Armida* by Nicolas Poussin, 1628

When Lull's patron was exiled in 1652, Lulli secured release from her employ and found work as a servant to Louis XIV's cousin, Anne-Marie-Louise d'Orleans and as a dance and mime at the royal court, where he danced alongside, and made friends with, the teenaged king. Upon the death of his violin teacher the next year, Lulli assumed the man's position as court composer of ballroom music. In 1669, Jean-Baptiste Lully was naturalized and managed to finagle the rights to manage it from its originally designated patent holder (Pierre Perrin, 1620-1675). From then on he was a **musical Sun King**, the absolute autocrat of French music, which he re-created in his own image.

Lully把Perrin创作歌剧的专利拿到，开始一发不可收拾地创作，被称为“音乐上的太阳王”。

Jean-Basptiste Moliére（莫里哀，1622-1673）French comic playwright，以前和Lully合作，但后来被其打压话剧创作

The Paris Opera is the primary opera and ballet company of France. It was founded in 1669 by Louis XIV (through Pierre Perrin) as the Académie d'Opéra,
and shortly thereafter wns placed under the leadership of Jean-Baptiste Lully and officially renamed the Académie Royale de Musique, but continued to be
known more simply as the Opéra. 

相当于重塑了法兰西对于歌剧的民族认同

Lully's style did not merely define an art from,it defineda national identity. The monumental mythological or heroic-historical plots, some chosen by the king himself. Celebrated the implacable universal order and the supremacy of divine or divinely appointed rulers.

Lully和Quinault合作*Alceste*, 1674，在宫廷中演出

在此之际，法国歌剧也形成了一套程序。

French Overture（invented by Camber）"a universal code for pump"，法国序曲

（回想：之前也有Toccata曲）

## French Overture

- 第一段较慢dotted rhythms and rapid note to strong beats（4/4拍中，插入有附点的音乐，容易听出来。有的时候还会按此风格自由演出乐谱上没有的部分）（**A**）
- 第二段稍快quick and contrapuntal，用到对位法（B）
- 第三段像第一段，但是弱一点（A）
- (**A**)×2, (BA)×2
- **A A** B A B A

（这一点又返回影响了意大利歌剧）

J.S. Bach也写过French Overture from BWV 831，只不过他把附点中间的停顿用其他的音符填满。

开局还要有一段开场白讲话，感谢国王

"What the overture served to introduce was an obligatory panegysic prologue （开场自）of a full act's duration, vastly outstripping its Italian courtly prototype."

## Dance

例如*Atys*., Prologue中，必要的就是大量的舞蹈，（国王的歌剧）

*Chaconne* or *passacaglia*

这两个有些难区分。

Passacaille，里面有数字低音，有Chaconne，羽管键琴伴奏。

"'The contemporary allegorical relevance of the plot, proclaimed at the first in the prologue and affirmed at the last by the passacaglia (Armide], was what really counted in a tragédie lyrique. The whole drama was conceived as a sublimated court ritual. Royal and noble spectators did not seek transcendence of contemporary reality but rather its cosmic [mythical and heroic] confirmation. They did not value the kind of verisimilitude that makes the imaginary seems real. They wanted just the opposite: to see the real-that is, themselves, projected into the domain of fable and archetype."

Opera: *tragédie en musique* (summary)

- Created by Jean-Baptiste Lully and Philippe Quinault in 1673, with *Cadmus sa Hermione*; their final completed operas, *Armide*, premiered in 1686
- Form of musical tragedy that combines music, poetry, dance, and spectacle
- Mythological subject matter (gods aand larger-than life heros), with stage machinery creating spectacle
- The use of ***recitative*** makes continuous musical drama possible
- The distinction of ***recitative*** and ***air*** expressesthe distinction between dialogue and lyrical expression

**法国不叫aria，叫air**

Three Scenes from Cadmus et Hermione

- Act 2, scene 4: Cadmus and Hermione say farewell to each other as Cadmus prepares to fight a dragon: **lyrical dialogue**
- Act 2, scene 5: After Cadmus departs, Hermione is left alone to lament her fare as a suffering lover, directly addressing Cupid (*Amour*): monologue
- Act 2, scene 6: Cupid descends from the heavens to comfort Hermione:
    **divertissement**, combining solo song and dance (animated golden statues)

The goddess Cybèle(西布莉)has fallen in love with a mortal man, Atys, and she raises him to the position of high priest in the cult of her worshipers. Atys, however, is in love with Sangaride(桑佳丽德)，who loves him in turn, although she is to be wedded to the king, Célenus. Enraged and jealous, Cybèle causes Atys to lose his senses and murder Sangaride (hallucinating that she is a monster); once he returns to his senses, he commits suicide as an act of revenge against Cybèle. Grieving, Cybèle transforms Atys into a pine tree as an eternal symbol of love.

法国歌剧偶尔会有一点颤音shine，作修饰。

Lully控制他的作品，不允许演唱家自主发挥。

"Lully is ranting at everybody. Everyone wants to shine in *Atys*, and there
is no way to shine in this work of Lully's. **Everything is fashioned, calculated, measured** so that the action of the drama progresses without ever slackening. This singer takes it upon himself to add ornaments, showing down the beat; and in order to remain on stage longer and arouse a little more applause, drags out an air that Lully intended to be simple. short and natural. The danger begs for a futile repetition; the violin want to play when Lully asks for flutes. Everybody seeks his own reflection in *Abys*. **Lully has to defend his work**."

# The Baroque Keyboard Tradition

- 管风琴（Pipe Organ）
- 羽管键琴（Harpsichord），可以定做不同flavor，如法国、意大利和德国
- 楔槌键琴/古钢琴（Clavichord），late 16th or 17th century

## Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment

Jean Rondeau：当红法国harpsichord演奏家

Jean Rondeau records "Vertigo" for harpsichord (Joseph-Nicolas-Pancrace Royer, 1703-1755)

羽管键琴（Harpsichord）的发声原理是勾弦发声，所以弹奏者的手应该轻一些。这与弹钢琴的手感完全不一样。

"The stock of the instrument medium rose in consequence to the point where a major composer could be concerned primarily with music for instruments. Before the seventeenth century that had never happened."

Girolamo Frescobaldi (1583-1643)

在Saint Peter's Church, 一直工作到退休

> Frescobaldi was at once the most **"flamboyantly"** impressive keyboard composer of his time and the most characteristic, because it was characteristic of early seventeenth-century music to be **Flamboyantly impressive.**

## Instrumental Music in the Renaissance

其实地位并不怎样，最多做一个声部的伴奏。

- Based on vocal models
- <font color="red">Intabulation</font>，在吉他中意味着插值、在空隙内插入一些旋律
    from the Italian word *intavolatura*, refers to an <u>arrangement</u> of a vocal or ensemble piece for keyboard, **lute**, or other **plucked string instrument**, written in **tablature**（指谱法），在文艺复兴时期意味着改编。
    Example: Luis de Narvász (fl. 1526-49), *Cancion Mille regres* (ca. 1538)
- Variations *or* Variation Form
    Example: William Byrd, *Pavana Lanchryme*, based on *Flow, my tears* (John Dowland)

Abstract intrumental music

- <font color="red">Prelude, fantasia, ricercate</font>（赋格曲的前身）, <font color="red">toccata</font>
- <font color="red"><u>Ricercate</u></font> *or* ricercar: multi-sectional and imitative
- Cazona *or* <u>canzon</u>: contrapuntal, fast, originating as intabulations of French chansons

Frescobaldi的器乐更加知名。他有两种写法，其中第二种不凸显对位法的更适合当今的钢琴。

> Frescobaldi published sixteen volumes between 1608-1637. Of the sixteenth, only four volumes contatined vocal compositions (madrigals and continuo arias). The remaining twelve were devoted to instrumental works.

> The *libri d'intavolatura* contained Frescobaldi's most novel, most **theatrical**, and most elaborately "**open-ended**" compositions, and in that sense they reflected his most vividly over-the-top (i.e. "baroque") side.

在评价（Rome 1637）中，提到了以下几个概念：

<font color="red">Toccate</font> d'intavolatura di cembalo et organo, partite di diverse arie, e correnti, balleti, <font color="red">ciaccone</font>, <font color="red">passacagli</font> (Rome 1637)

Partite: variations over a ground bass, 简单理解为变奏曲，在低音部分变奏，重复循环低音型。

toccate: formally capricious and unpredictable, 与上面相反，不做重复，变化多端，不可预测。

## partite

Ciaccona (chacona)

A fair and furious dance in syncopated triple setter. As a dance, the *ciaccona* [improvisatory] was built over repetitive chord progressions. It was considered so inverterately lascivious that it was banished from the Spanish stage.（因为有强烈的性暗示而被禁止）

> Monteverdi published his setting of Ottavio Rinuccini's imitation of Petrarch's famous sonnet *Zefro torna* ("The breeze returns") in the form of a 'ciacona', and from then on it was a major Italian for **love poetry**, for **stage music**, and for **instrumental virtuosity**.

J.S. Bach的Violin Partita No. 2 in D minor, BWV 1004, ca. 1720: V. Ciaccona (Hilary John)中，运用了如下循环：D-C#-D-Bb-G-A-D

知名的“100次变奏”：Girolamo Frescobaldi, *Cento Partite sopra Passacagli* ("A Hundred Variations on Passacalles",1637)

红圈到蓝圈变奏，从Re到La

区别：Chaconne和Passacaglia（其实很细微）

> *Passacagli* is Italian for *passacalles*, a related Spanish genre consisting of variations on cadential patterns that apparently grew out of the habits of guitarists who accompanied courtly singers, and who introduced and bestrewed the songs with casual ritornellos-the kind of thing accompanists in today's nonliterate ("pop") genres call "vamping". Like today's popular guitarists and keyboardists, who often take off on their vamping figures for impressive flights of fancy, so the players of *passacagli* often elaborated them into long instrumental interludes, eventually into independent instrumental showpieces.

> The repetitive cadential phrases of the *ciaccona* and the *passacagli* were a natural for adaptation to traditional ground-bass techniques, and that is how they entered the domain of written music.

成就：把chaconn写下来，不需要即兴。分别创造了两套，

> The first literate <font color="red">instrumental adaptations</font> of the *ciaccona* and *passacagli* were by Frescobaldi. His second *libro d'intavolatura*, published in 1627, contained both a set of *Partite sopra ciaccona* ("variations on the chacona") and one *Partite sopra passacagli* (" variations on passacalles")

总结：

> Frescobaldi's fanciful mixture of sameness and contrast gave instrumental music access to a while new temporal plane, and a new **dramatized** character. This was music with real "content", not just an accessory to vocal performances or a liturgical time-filler.

有学者认为两者挺混乱。虽说求同存异，但是像A mixed bag…

> *Cento Partite sopra Passacagli*: "A Mixed Bag /Compendium of Variations on Passacaglias"

虽然刚刚是Re到La，但百变奏曲中也有Fa到Do的变奏，且结尾处处理得也和开头不同。

> The lack of 'tonal unity' has led some writers to suggest that the work is no 'composition' at all, but just an assortment of goods. Other writers have even suggested that the components were printed, in the **wrong order** as the result of 'some sort of misha at the printer's office.'

## toccata（托卡塔，触技曲）

formally capricious and unpredictable

有点像弹琴开头的调音，后来独立成乐章。

> "The lack of tonal unity has led some writers to suggest that the work is no "composition'"at all, but just an assortment of goods. Other writers have even suggested that the components were printed, in the wrong order as the result of "some sort of mishap at the printer's office."

因为不依赖于特定的音型，且没有重复，所以对于作曲家的要求很高。

> "Although Frescobaldi's printed works give sufficient evidence of his skill, still, to get a true idea of his deep knowledge, one must hear him  <font color="red">improvise</font> toccatas full of admirable refinements and inventions." (André Maugars)

在进行的过程中，经常更换主题。例如Toccata for harpsichord. Toccata No. 3, ca. 1615, revised in 1637

### Toccata: definition

- <u>multi-sectional organizaition</u> in improvisatory style, introducing and "developing" distinctive gestures and figures; spontaneous and unpredictable (*toccata* = "<font color="red">touched</font>" as in exploring the keys and tuning of the instrument, often introducing another piece)
- 多段体、即兴风格、前导性。

注意：ricercar后来独立出去了。

> The earliest recorded use of the word "toccata" in a musical source occurs in a lute collection of 1536, where it refers to the kind of brief **improvisatory prelude** formerly called <font color="red">*preambulum*</font> or <font color="red">*ricercar*</font> or even *taster de corde* ("checking to see if the strings are in tune"). The new term was evidently coined to sabstiture for "ricercar" when the later term had become firmly associated with "strict" imitative compositions.

重点：触技曲，只有Frescobaldi，且说可以止于随性之处，可以自己选择性弹其中的一段。

> Later on, pieces called 'toccata achieved greater dimensions and independent status, but they always remained "free" and open in form, deriving their continuity from discontinuity, to put it paradoxically, That is, **they relied on contrast**—in <font color="red">texture, meter, tempo, tonality</font>—between short striking sections, rather than the continuous development of motives, to sustain interest. "Striking" meant virtuosic as well; toccatas, like the preluding improvisations of old, were often **festive display** pieces that turned the very act of laving into **a form of theater.**
>
> In the toccatas, I have taken care not only that they be abundantly provided with different passages and affections but also that each one of the said passages can be **played separately**, <u>the performer is thus under no obligation to finish them all but can end where he thinks best.</u> (Frescobaldi)

## Organ Mass

Frescobaldi曾出版《音乐之花》1635

其中第一段是前奏toccata。总体是多段体。

*Toccate di durezze e ligature/toccata chromatica in Fiori musicali* ("Musical Flowers" 1635)
(toccatas with dissonances and suspensions)

> 插入：为什么Renaissance期间不崇尚器乐，却也有改编？虽然不入主流，但是在民间家庭还是有的。

Toccatas accompanying the church service: Organ Masses

弥撒是教堂的仪式，指的是用管风琴伴奏。

Toccata用法：

1. 单独用，例如Frescobaldi出版的
2. Organ Masses的伴奏
3. Toccata Chromatica，放在这种曲子的最后，指的是在自然大调中加入很多半音，增加紧张感。
    因为一般在这一段演奏时，神父会做神秘仪式，有种神秘和痛苦的感觉，达到弥撒的升华作用。
4. Ricercar（里切尔卡），是赋格（Fugue）的前身，是一种复调。本意Ricercare (It.): "to seek, attempt, research, pursue."，意思是找寻。
    1. 有什么特征？a contrapuntal Ricercare is in **imitative** texture throughout. 一个声部进入后，另一个声部跟随着模仿。
    2. 巴赫的变化更加多端，加上音符的逆行和拍子调整。并尝试在作品中穷举可能的音符组合。
5. Frescobaldi写的开放式乐谱，指每个声部分开写，Open Score。但是对于演奏者挑战性很强。
6. 在Frescobaldi写的Ricercar中，soprano先唱一小段，然后tenor跟上，然后bass跟上等等。
7. Frescobaldi在写作时，还会拖长音符时值。

## Kanon

Kanon.也是一种模仿，不过区别在于，Kanon要严格地照搬，而Ricercar的“模仿”还可以升半音等。

同时，用到了Chaccone的持续低音。

Pachelbel. Canon in D major。

## Toccata and Fugue

这好像是矛盾的组合，Toccata and Fugue，一个随意，一个严肃。J. S. Bach有所演绎。

## Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck(Dutch)

1562-1621

Founder of the Northern German Orchestra

在复调作品比较保守，键盘作品又比较激进。我们重点关注

他写了很多用Virginal（英国版的羽管键琴）演奏的曲目。例如这首*Fantasia Cromatica*

> Once Sweelinck had absorbed the **English** styles and genres, moreover, he's work began circulating in England along with native wares. A fantasia by Sweelinck is found in the so-called Fitzwilliam **Virginal** Book., a mammonth collection of English keyboard music.

这个乐器是站着弹奏的。

在曲目中，用到了四种不同的节奏型。设定了第一个片段后，调整了后面的音符时值以创作后面的片段。

> It's a summit of virtuosity, displaying the subject **at four different rhythmic levels** and reaching a peak of rhythmic excitement. This is similar to the style of English keyboard figuration.

## 叔侄 Louis Couperin (ca. 1626-1661) and François Couperin (1668-1733)

叔叔：在Johann Sebastian Bach的Prelude in C major, BWV 846中，使用了他发明的*Style brisé* ("broken [chord] style")，把和弦打碎重组。

他写的乐谱没有小节线，只有连着的一堆曲线，时值也自由。被称为Unmeasured Prelude.

**Tuneless**? J. S. Bach/Charles Gounod, *Ave Maria*

Louis Couperin, *Prelude en La menor* (ca. 1690)就是他写的典型风格。

模仿此传统作的：*Unmeasured Prelude* (*Prélude non measuré*), Jean-Philippe Rameau (1706)

成就主要是侄子的。他被称为“法国巴洛克键盘作品的瑰宝”。他也服务于Louis XIV，不过Lully写歌剧，François Couperin负责写键盘乐。

同时，他也崇拜Areangelo Coreli（科雷利，1653-1713，意大利），还写作了Le Parnasse ou L' Apothéose de Corelli - 科雷利颂。

他写作了一本书，记录他自己独特的**装饰音**。

*Graces or argémens*: conventionalized, localized ornaments

*Les Moissonneurs*: 开垦田地收获者，这首里面就有很多装饰音。

这已经有些Exquisite（典雅）洛可可（rococo）风格。

> Rococo art expressed the same sort of aristocratic. "public" sentiments (including the sort of amorous or melancholy sentiments that can be aired in polite society) that we have already identified as *galant*.

Clavecíníste 夜莺 "Play slowly, and very briefly, although basicaally in time."

(Character Piece: A portrait of a bird and emotion in a dance form)

François Couperin, *Le Rossignol en Amour* ("The Nightingale in Love") 14th Order (set), no. 1

还有，Fancy Version ("*double*")，算是加强版，装饰音更加夸张和繁复。

## The Italian Concerto Style and the Emergence of Tonality

Arcangelo Corelli and Antonio Vivadi

在康熙朝内工作的传教士有一位Theodoric Pedrini, 通称De Liege德里格，1671-1746，喜欢Corelli的作品。还在宫中演奏过。

Corelli本身是一位小提琴炫技家，主写弦乐室内乐作品。他为两种体裁固定了标准：sonatas和concertos。比如，西方的大小调概念就是他确立的。

> As a virtuoso violinist, Corelli was the first European composer who enjoyed international recognition as a "great" **exclusively** on the strength of his finely wrought **instrumental ensemble works** (chamber and orchestral music for strings). He standardized genres (**sonatas and concertos**) and practices, and setting instrumental music on an epoch-making path of ascendency. His works may no longer be played much except by violin students, and yet their historical significance is tremendous.

## 1. *<font color="red">Sonata</font> da chiesa* (church sonata) (教堂奏鸣曲)

> They were often played during Mass to accompany liturgical actions between the scripture readings, at the collection, or at Communion. It usually had **four main sections** in contrasting tempos (movements), casting in two slow-fast pairs resembling preludes and fugues such as organists were used to improvising.

sonata：是乐器音乐的写作方式。且以室内乐为主。比如贝多芬写过20多首独奏sonata。

主要有四个段落，不过每个段落可能不会有明显的结束。所以我们现在看到的sonata都有多个乐章，相当于把多希体的每一段拉长了。

固定模式为：**慢—快—慢—快**

快板乐章里声部之间会做一定模仿，就像之前说的一样。

## 2. *Sonata da camera* (chamber sonata or concerto)（室内奏鸣曲）

> It was essentially a <font color="red">dance suit</font>, which Corelli adapted to the prevailing **four-movement** format.

固定模式也为：**慢—快—慢—快**

例如No.9 *Sonata in Bb major*

快板乐章中用到了库朗特舞曲（三拍子）、嘉禾舞曲。

## “教堂”与“室内”风格的重叠

Trio Sonata（三重奏鸣曲）

### Trio sonata

The **trio sonata** typically written for two melody instruments (such as two violins) as basso continuo

Between 1681 and 1694 Corelli published 48 trio sonatas in four collections of twelve, alternating <u>church sonatas</u> and <u>chamber sonatas</u>.

编号一、三的都是教堂（church）奏鸣曲，编号二、四的都是室内奏鸣曲（chamber），No几就是12号中的第几部，然后再说乐章几。

- Twelve Trio-Sonatas, Op. 1 (dedicated to Queen Christina of Siveden) published in Rome in 1681 (church sonata)
- Twelve Chamber Sonatas, Op. 2 (dedicated to Cardinal Panfili), published in Rome in 1685 (chamber sonata)
- Twelve Trio-Sonatas, Op. 3 (dedicated to Francesco II d'Este, Duke of Modena), published in Rome in 1689 (church sonata)
- Twelve Trio-Sonatas, Op. 4 (dedicated to Cardinal Ottoboni), published in Rome in 1694. (chamber sonata)

在慢板中用到的低音，称为“走路低音”（Walking Bass）。特点为音程接近，比较舒缓。

巴赫模仿过Corelli 的三重奏鸣曲，用羽管键琴，两个声部加一个Walking Bass。

## The Emergence of Tonality（调性）

以前有调式的说法，其中品类繁多。Corelli钟爱其中的大小调，并将其发扬光大。

1. Intense, Agitation
2. Running patterns. throughout
3. "Atheletic" movements
4. "Hocket" effect （嚆唶调，after m.7 between 2 violins）,译为“分解旋律”者,或“切分歌”者
5. Tonal Harmony

形成五度循环后（Circle of Fifths），形成属和弦（V）到主和弦（I）的循环。

- It was precisely in Corelli's time the late seventeenth century, that **the circle of fifths** was being theorized as the main propeller of harmonic motion, and it was Corelli more than any other one composer who put that new idea into telling practice.
- Corelli stands as protagonist of this all-important development—one that put instrumental music on a path of ascendency that would ultimately challenge the preeminent status of vocal genres. For in no other composer of the time is the circle of fifths quite so conspicuously and copiously deployed

为了使循环快速结束，改变了mi的调性

i iv VII III VI ii v(V) i

G-C-F-Bb, Eb-A-D-G

<font color="red">When the diatonic circle of fifths became the basis of harmonic practice, the major-minor tonal system can be said to have achieved its full claboration.</font> The fully claborated system's birthplace was the Italian music of the <font color="red">1680s</font>. The carliest example known to the author of the use of a full diatonic circle of fifths to circumscribe and this establish a diatonic tonality occurs in a tiny aria from the third act of L' Adimiro, Alessandro Scarlatti's chird opera, first performed in the cheater of the Royal Place at Naples in November 1683.

到贝多芬时代，还可以继续缩短：i ~~iv VII III VI~~ ii v(V) i，抽离出一小段的ii v(V) i

后面又变成了i iv v(V) i

> "The circle of fifths] is a typical of the northern Italian instrumental ensemble music of the time, which for that reason stands as one of the great watershed repertories in the history of European music. It is certainly no accident, moreover, that tonality' as a fully elaborated system emerged furst in the context of instrumental music. Instrumental music stood in far greater need of a potent tonal unifier like the circle of fifths than did vocal music, which can as easily take its shape from its text as from any internal process.

Melodic Sequences（旋律<font color="red">模进</font>），即保持音程升调

> Modern tonality is established through "melodic sequences" or suspensions underpinned with dynamic circle-of-fifths harmonies.
> Richard Taruskin, The Oxford History of Western Music (New York, 2010), 2:189.

巴赫模仿1 4 7 3 6 2 5 1

目前这两者结合在一起挺好，比如听到五度循环就可能会用模进，听到模进也可能用五度循环。

Corelli standarized <u>**sonatas and concertos**</u>.

## Concerto Grosso（大协奏曲）

跟独奏协奏曲不一样（一个对应一个管弦乐队），若干独奏/管弦乐队对应一个大协奏曲。

基本只见于巴洛克时期

The **concerto grosso** is a form of baroque music in which the musical material is passed between <font color="red">a small group of soloists</font> (the <font color="red">*concertino*</font>) and <font color="green">full orchestra</font> (the *ripieno*, *tutti* or <font color="green">*concerto grosso*</font>). This is in contrast to the **solo concerto** which features a single solo instrument with the melody line, accompanied by the orchestra.

红发神父（red-hir priest）Antonio Vivadi，（1678-1741）

Impoertant colletions, with date of publication

- *L‘ estro armonico* (The HArmonic Inspiration, 1711)
    12 concertos, includng no.6 and no. 8 in A minor
- *La stravaganza* (The Extraordinary, 1716)
    12 concertos for solo violin
- *Il cimento dell'armonia e dell'invenzione*
    (The Contest between Harmony and Invention, 1725)
    12 concertos, including the *Four Seasons*

Vivaldi在孤儿院写器乐曲，现存500首，实际上也会写Opera，不过这方面的名声被掩盖。

350/500: solo concertos，给有天分的小女孩

230/350: for violins

> Vivaldi's official duties at the Pietà were the spur that caused him to produce concert in such fantastic abundance. The most popular Vinetian composer of **opera** and **oratorio** in his day, he was superbly prolific in those genres as well, and internationally famous. But it is with his 500 surviving concertos that his name is irrevocably linked.

>These were the concertos that were expressly composed for the outstanding girl musicians the figlie privilegiati, as they were called--whose Vivaldi trained and led.

> Published in the aftermath of World War II as a national treasure in a huge series of editions prepared by a leading Italian composer of the day, Gian Francesco Malipiero, these previously unknown Vivaldi concertos were a major spur to the so-called '**post-war Baroque boom**' that wakened active performing and recording interest in many forgotten repertoires of **early music**.

Vivaldi在Corelli四段式的基础上又去掉一个，变成三个乐章：快—慢—快

Three-Movement Model

1. Fast *ritornello*

> "However, in a structural sense, the solos have a much less important role, merely providing modulatory transitions from one scale degree to the next. They are the exact functional equivalent of the 'episodes between the expositions in a fugue. The soloist never repeats. Thus the typical concerto movement is a fascinating interplay of the fixed and the fluid: one body of players is confined to a single idea, while the other is seemingly unconstrained in its spontaneously unfolding. One group only repeats, the other never repeats. One role is dramatically subordinate but structurally dominant, the other is dramatically dominant but structurally subordinate. This effect together is one of complementation, of disparate parts fitting harmoniously into a satisfying, functionally differentiated whole, all of it grounded by the constant auxiliary presence of the basso continuo, everyone's companion and aide."

### 1685? Early Music?



> "The year 1685 is luminous in the history of European music, because it witnessed the birth of three of the composers whose works long formed the bedrock of the standard performing repertoire, or 'canon', as it crystallized in the nineteenth century. The three carliest composers were in active repertory and so the number 1685 took on the aspect of a barrier, separating the music of common listening experience from a semi prehistoric repertoire called 'early music'. However, this barrier has  oftened given that our concert life has been enriched by many performing artists and ensembles who confine themselves to music earlier than that of the class of 1685. And, one aspect of the popularization of 'pre-Bach' music has been an effort to reclaim the class of 1685 as specialist repertoire, which paradoxically means separating so-called 'early music' from the 'standard performing canon as crystallized in the nineteenth century."

在欧洲音乐史上，1685 年是光辉灿烂的一年，因为在这一年诞生了三位作曲家，他们的作品长期以来构成了标准演奏曲目（或称 “卡农”）的基石。这三位最有才华的作曲家都是活跃的演奏家，因此 1685 这个数字就像一道屏障，将人们常听的音乐与被称为 “早期音乐 ”的半史前剧目隔开。然而，这种隔阂往往已不复存在，因为许多演奏家和乐团将自己的演奏范围局限于 1685 年之前的音乐，从而丰富了我们的音乐会生活。而且，“巴赫以前 ”音乐的普及之一是努力将 1685 年的音乐重新恢复为专业曲目，这矛盾地意味着将所谓的 “早期音乐 ”从 “19 世纪形成的标准演奏曲目 ”中分离出来。

> With the King (George I of England) as a virtual absence ruler, Handel was left remarkably free of official duties. He made a lengendary fortune, the first such fortune earned by musical enterprise alone in the history of art.

> "Handel's largest instrumental compositions, like Bach's, were orchestral suites. Those works arose directly out of his employment by the Hanoverian kings of England. One was a kind of super-suite, an enormous medley of instrumental pieces of every description composed for performance on a barge that kept abreast of George I's pleasure boat during a royal outing on the River Thames on 17 July 1717, later published as "Handel's Celebrated Water Musick." A whole day's entertainment, it furnished enough pieces for three separate sequences (suites in F, D, and G) as arranged by the publisher."

> "Handel's other big orchestral suite was composed for an enormous wind band and performed on 27 April 1749 as part of the festivities surrounding the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle that ended the War of the Austrian Succession. This was a great diplomatic triumph for George Il, who had personally led his troops in battle and won important trade and colonial concessions from the other European powers, including a monopoly on the shipping of slaves from African to Spanish American. Handel's suite was published as "**The Musick for the Royal Fireworks** (1749)"

### The Orchestral Suite

The *Water Music* is a collection of dances organized into threee suites.

The dances are "stylized", 不需要人跳舞，(i.e., not actual dance music) and are structured in conventional forms, such as the binary form **AB**.

A suite is a series of dance movements.

#### Suite no.2 in D major

11. (No tempo marking)
12. Alla Hornpipe
13. Minuet
14. Lenternment
15. Bournee

这种舞曲有不同的速度，组成不同小段。

> *Water Music* and *Royal Fireworks* have gained modern repertory status and they lost it when England lost her empire. Handel's instrumental music was always a sideline, and so it remains for audiences today, even though modern audiences value instrumental music far more highly  than did the audience of Handel's time and are much more likely to regard instrumental works as a composer's primary legacy.

### *Opera Seria* (Serious Opera) (between 1710s to 1770s)

Vivaldi的手法也来源于正歌剧里。

*Julius Caesar* in an example of ***opera seria***, or serious opera, the preeminent form of Italian opera in the eighteenth century.

The plot centers on Caesar's campaign against Pompey in Egypt, his liaison
with Cleopatra, and the defeat of his enemy, Ptolemy,

An *opera seria* is constructed as a series of recitatives (dialogues) and arias
(lyrical expressions of sentiment), with occasional choruses.

The aria is typically in an ABA form; the second "A" is called the *da capo*, and it repeats the opening section with added vocal ornamentation (ritornello form)

例如激动风格的Three-Part Ritornello (<font color="blue">R S1 R S2 R</font> <font color="red">S</font> <font color="blue">R S1 R S2 R</font>), *Stile Concitato*

Handel: "Vivi, tiranno!" From *Rodeinda*（《罗德琳达》1725）Christopher Dumaux (countertenor) Budapest Festival Orchestra

Ritornello段与Solo段越来越难以区分了，这也让戏剧化的冲突增多。

> "The opposition of solo and tutti is dramatized beyond anything we have seen in an instrumental concerto. It is made exceptionally tense—even hostile—by having the instruments continuously insinuate the ritornello within the episodes (solo) whenever the singer pauses for breath, only to be silenced peremptorily on the voices return. This is expressive of an unusually tense and hostile affect.

在London的时间，Handel可谓赚得盆满钵满。

> It is Handel who displays the genre at its best, owing to the balancing the tangling of musical and dramatic values. His works is more craftsmanly and structurally complex than that of his actual Italian contemporaries. By making his music more interesting in its own right than that of his Italian
> contemporaries, he gave performers correspondingly less room to maneuver and dominate the show."

事情发生了变化。

> Unlike the actual Italian product, Handel's operas never traveled well but remained a local and somewhat anomalous English phenomenon,
> admired by foreign visitors but nevertheless regarded as strange. A crisis was reached when Farinelli refused to sing for Handel and in fact joined a rival company set up in ruinous opposition to him.

著名阉人歌手Farinelli拒绝唱Handel的歌剧。从此，意大利人亲自来英国唱的增多了。

> Beginnig in the 1730s, operatic tastes in London began to catch up with the continent. A rival company, the Opera of the Nobility, managed to engaged the latest Italian composers. Both Handel and his competitors were **near bankruptcy**, and Handel was forced out of the opera business.

第三个最大的危机是英国本土“低俗”的乞丐歌剧。用英语唱。

> Another bad omen for Handel, the worst in fact, was the huge success in 1728 of ***The Beggar's Operas***, a so called "ballad opera" by John Gay, with a libretto in English, **spoken dialogue** in the place of recitative, and a score consisting entirely **popular songs** arranged by a German expatriate composer named Johann Pepusch (1667-1752).

> The cynical slap in the face of "noble" entertainments like the *seria* had an unprecedented run of 62 performances during its first sense, and, altogether amazingly, was revived every season for the rest of the eighteenth century and beyond. It was characterized as "frivolous nihilistic" (轻浮的虛无主义）But it also played into a **prejudice** that was the very opposite of frivolous or nihilistic--namely, a peculiarly English version of the old prejudice against 'delicious' music as a courupting force that was inimical to the public welfare.

> "In an Essay upon Public Spirit published in 1711, the year of Handel's
> Land debut, John Dennis (a London critic, 1657-1734) argued that British wives should keep their men away from the opera lest they become '**effeminate**'（女性化)。One need hardly add that all of these fears and intolerances intersected on the sexually ambiguous figure of the castrato, the very epitome of Italian license and excess, who added insult to injury by commanding princely fees far beyond the earning power of domestic singers."

> "The *Beggar's Opera* gave all of these resentful views a colossal boost. Its success was a presage that the *opera seria*, even Handel's, could **no longer count on the English audience to take it seriously**. And indeed, within a decade of its production, both Handel's own opera company and the Opera of the Nobility had gone bankrupt."

英国本土歌剧开始排挤其余的作品。最终结果是英国自己没有严肃歌剧。

> Neither Handel nor the castrati were the losers, though. If *The Beggar's Opera* was a bad omen it was because it "killed not the Italian opera but the chances of serious English opera.
> (Christopher Hogwood)

## Handel's inspiration

正歌剧不再赚钱，如何解决自己的危机？他开始转向清唱剧。

Whenever opera had encountered obstacles on its Italian home turf, its create energies had found an outlet in **oratorio**（清唱剧，神剧）, especially in Rome, where Handel had served his apprenticeship.

没有舞台布景的、以《圣经》为主的歌剧。其中加强了合唱段，去掉了一些无意义的讲话内容。

"Biblical operas are presented without staging"

### How was it new?

Handel's adaption of this old-fashioned genre was really something quite new: full-length works in the <font color="red">vernacular</font> rather than Latin, <font color="red">without a narrator's part</font>, but with many <font color="red">thrilling choruses</font>, sometimes participating in the action, sometimes reflecting to it to represent as a collective entity.

An operatic bankrupt loomed, these experiences gave Handel an idea that the English public might welcome a new style of <font color="red">vernacular oatorio</font> tailored to its tastes and prejudices. As a genre born directly out of the vicissitudes of the British entertainment market.

In England, the acting out of a sacred drama was prohibited by episcopal decree, <font color="red">but *Saul*（《扫罗》） was **still more or less** an opera in the sense that its unstaged action</font> proceeded through the same musical structures, its dramatic confrontations, being carried out through the customary **recitatives and arias**, making it easy for the audience to supply in their imagination the implied stage movement. 

"The Listener's Mind's Eye"

1. Opulent masque-like choruses representing the "People of Israel."
2. An especially lavish orchestra replete with a trombone choir, with evocative carillons（钟琴）, and with virtuoso instrumenral solos, as if to compensate for the diminished visual component.
3. The title character (human relations) is complex, and the action implies a judgment of his deeds.

> Handel showed his mettle (skills) in catering to his public, for the English audience—an insular（海岛的，保守的） people, an industrious and properous people, since the evolutions of the 17th century a self-determined people ruled by law, and a latently chauvinistic people—identified strongly with the **Old Testament Isrealites** and regarded the tales Handel set before them as gratifying allegories of themselves.

慢慢地，清唱剧从宗教内容为主变成以国家英雄主义为主。

Civic Heroism and National Triumph

此后，出现了**Nationalistic Works**，成为了能代表国家精神的作品。

> Handel deploys the analogy of Britain with Israel to present the idea of a unified nation as natural, desirable, and, in the face of foreign aggression, essential… Handel's music is an impetus that can not only allude to, but actually create, national harmony and strength. (Ruth Smith)

这也是欧洲史上首次。

> Handel's oratorios were the first great monuments in the history of European music to nationalism (R. Taruskin)

### Israel in Egypt (1739)

*Israel in Egypt* (1739) after *Saul* transformed the genre further away from opera and made it yet more novel and more specific to its time and place. For *Israel in Egypt* almost completely abandons the dramatic format—that is, the representation of human conflict and confrontations through recitatives and arias—in favor of impersonal biblical narration, much of it carried out by the chorus (i.e. the Nation) directly, often split into two antiphonal choirs.

这部开始，歌剧的形式被淡化，尽量把人与人之间的戏剧性争执、矛盾简化，大部分还是对圣经内容的想法。歌剧变得静态，更像是一幕幕的合唱。

Vastness, Impressiveness, sublime

"This specifically Handelian conception of the oratorio as an essentially choral genre (an invisible pageant rather than an invisible drama completely transformed the very idea of such a piece."

~~"Although called Oratorio, yet it is not dramatic but properly a Collection of Hymns or Anthems drawn from the sacred Scripture~~.

转变成中庸的定义Oratorio：

An **oratorio** combines recitatives and arias, with a significant role given to the chorus. The action or "plot" is based on a religious subject; in certain respects, the oratorio is like an unstaged, sacred opera (Biblical operas).

在本部作品中，Handel发扬了<font color="red">madrigalist art</font>。

> In *Israel in Egypt*, Handel adopts music-dramatic technique the <font color="red">madrigalist art</font> (the art of musical depiction). Handel's technique in this aspect perhaps even outstripped Vivaldi.

比如，其中模仿过青蛙、苍蝇、虱子和冰雹等。

> "The idea of purely instrumental 'imitation of nature'
> was a Vivaldian idea, as we know from the *Four Seasons*, but no other composer had ever taken instrumental imitation to such lengths as Handel resorted to in *Israel in Egypt*-epoch-making lengths, in fact, since the art of "orchestration" as "tone-color composition" serving expressive or poetic purposes and requiring **an extended instrumental "palette"** achieved a new level in Handel's oratorios!"

Entertainment, Immediately to be Understood

> "Like all madrigalists, composers depend on mechanisms of humors: puns (plays on similarities of sound), wit (apt conjunctions of incongruous things), caricature (deliberate exaggerations that underscore a similarity). And, as Handel knew very well, audience react to such effects, despite the awfulness of the theme."

Self v.s. Other

> "The withholding of empathy for the Egyptians is an essential part of the biblical account of the Exodus, and the scores of the biblical Israelites and their religious descendants for the ancient oppressor is what enables the success of Handel's strategy. This separation of self and other plans also into the ideology of nationalism; a great deal of English national pride depends on a perception of separateness from other nations, and superiority to them. Of all Handel's oratorios, it is perhaps easier to see in Israel in Egypt how the manifest religious content coexists with, enable us, and is ultimately subordinate to the nationalistic subtext. Hence the essential secularism of its impulse and its enduring appeal."

弥塞亚本来是世俗作品，只不过特别适合在圣诞节演唱。

#### Messiah

"Nationalism applies even to Messiah (1741), the one Handel oratorio that was performed within the composer's lifetime in consecrated buildings and could count, therefore, as a religious observance."

> "Messiah is still regularly performed in churches, Anglican and otherwise, especially at Christmas time. But, it is much more often performed in concert halls by secular choral societies. That is appropriate, since, like the rest of Handel's oratorios, Messiah's true affinities remain thoroughly theatrical."

由于误解了主题，又被放在教堂演出，它被圣化了。

> "What distinguished Messiah from its fellows and gave rise to its occasional special treatment was its subject matter. The subject, the life of Christ the Redeemer with emphasis first on the portents sutrounding his birth, and then on his death and resurrection, brings the work into line with the most traditional ecclesiastical oratorios, and with the even older tradition of narrative Passion settings."

> *Messiah* became a perennial and indispensable favorite with the London public when Handel began giving charity performances of it in the **chapel** of the London Foundling Hospital, starting in 1750. These were the "**consecrated**"（圣化）performances that led to the works being regarded as an actual "**sacred oratorio**" although that was not the composer's original intention."

可以认为是最早的古典音乐。

> "By the end of the eighteenth century *Messiah* was accepted and revered as true **cathedral music. It is all the more illuminating, therefore, to emphasize and demonstrate its secular and theatrical side**. This aspect of the work can be vividly illustrated both from its fascinatingly enigmatic creative history and from its performance history.

> "The continuous performing tradition of European art (or literate) music can therefore be said to begin with *Messiah*, **the first "classic" in our contemporary repertoire**, and Handel is therefore the earliest of all "perpetually-in-repertory" (classical) composers."

### 世俗的两点：Parody ("Borrowing")，或者说“抄袭”

Handel was the champion of all parodists（仿作者）, adapting both his own works and those of other composers in unprecedented numbers and with unprecedented exactness.

还有一本书《亨德尔欠人家的》

"Noticing how many of Handel's "borrowings' involved works from the 1730s, and particularly the exceptionally busy years 1737-39, some historians have tried to connect his reliance on the music of other composers with a stroke suffered in the spring of 1737, brought on by overwork, that temporarily paralyzed Handel's right hand and kept him from his normal labors. Whether as evidence of generally deteriorated health or as a reason for especially hurried work following his enforced idleness, the stroke has been offered as an extenuating circumstance by some who have sought to defend Handel from the charge of plagiarism"

辩护：

1. "Handel more often than not repaid with interest, clothing the borrowed material with new beauty and preserving it for generations that otherwise would scarcely have know of its existence: (Donald Jay Grout, paraphrasing Handel's contemporary Johann Mattheson)

2. What we call plagiarism was so regarded in Handel's day as well; that while widespread, it frequently drew sharp censure One of Handles critics, ironically enough, was Johann Mattheson (1681-1764), so often cited in Handel's defense, who openly and angrily accused Handel of copying a melody from one of his operas.

> Copy and Rearrangement…

自己借自己的没有问题：

In the case of *Messiah*, Handel's known borrowing were of the "cannibalistic" kind, the kind that even now entails little or no disrepute. *Self*-*borrowings*, which do not raise any question of ownership, can be called borrowing without euphemism. They are generally regarded, even in the strictest

著名意大利情色歌剧 Postmadrigalian genre (Italian love poetry): "Chamber Cantata" (chamber duet)

> No, I do not wish to trust you,
> Blind Cupid, cruel beauty!
> You are too wily,
> O flattered deities!
>
> Another time you did manage to to net my trust heart;
> So from having experienced your tricks
> I know you both for tyrants.

Should it surprise or dismay us to discover that this "crotic duet" became the basis for not one but two choruses in *Messiah*?

> "The use of such material as the basis for an oratorio on the life of Christ has tended to bemuse those for whom the sacred and the secular are mutually exclusive spheres. One way of excusing the apparent blasphemy has been to declare that the duetti, composed during the summer of 1741, were actually **sketches** for Messiah, composed that fall, and that therefore the text was merely a matter of convenience "**little more than a jingle**, words of no significance whatever, serving merely as a crystallizing agent for music which was later to be adapted to a text that had not even yet been choose, according to one squeamish specialist. Another write, the influential nineteenth-century formalist critic Eduard Hanslick, used the apparent incongruity to argue that the expressive content of music was unreal, and that any music **could plausibly go with any text**."

主要还是因为旋律比较迷人，以吸引听众为目的加进去的。

他为了进一步吸引听众，请阉人歌手唱弥赛亚中最重要的片段。

> "Despite its embodying the sacredest of themes, it was an entertainment, and its music was designed to amuse a public in search of diversion, however edifying. The musical qualities of the duets, being delightful in themselves, could retain their allure in the new context and adorn the new text-and even, thanks to Handel's 'madrigalist" genius, appear to illuminating its meaning."

大仇得报的爽文结局

> "Handel was getting his own back in many ways. By hiring the latest divine "ragazzò" or Italian boy, **he was getting his own back against Farinelli**, who had so disastrously snubbed him. By scoring such a hit with his new aria di bravura he was vindicating the exotic entertainments he had ben forced so long ago to give up. And by making the British public love **the infusion of Italian manners** into the quintessential British spectacle, he may have been taking a sweetly secret personal revenge on the stolid tastemakers who had forced him to deny his predilections in more ways than one-for as many scholars now agree, **Handel, a lifelong bachelor, was probably what we would now call a closeted gay man**."

# Introduction to J.S Bach

Keyboard works

他是一个Encyclopedist, Synthesizer

"The number 1685 took on the aspect of a barrier, separating the music of common listening experience from a semiprebistoric repertoire called "early music. [However], artistic who perform ['early music] still specialize in it, and one aspect of the popularization of 'pre-Bach' music has been an effort to reclaim the class of 1685 as specialist repertoire, which paradoxically means separating it [pre-Bach'] from the standard performaing canon（经典) as crystallized in the nineteenth century and playing it in the pre-Bach' category."

The formation of **canon** (canonization) of the old performing repertory happened in the 19-th century.

"Why did the music of the class of 1685' become the foundation stone of the standard repertory once it was formed?"

"Why does the music of the class of 1685' remain the earliest music that nonspecialist performers and 'mainstream' performing organizations routinely include in their active repertoires even today?"

> Much of the music that both Handel and Scarlatti regarded as the most important music of their careers has perished from active use, while a lot of music that they regarded as quite secondary (Scarlatti's keyboard music and Handel's suites for orchestra) is standard fare today. Bach, who never even wrote an opera, was an altogether atypical and marginal figure in his day. Seeing him, as we do, as being a pillar of the standard performing repertory means seeing him in a way that his contemporaries would never have understood?

原因：

1. Tonal Idiom
2. Instrumental Medium
3. Aesthetic Purposes (German Romanticism)

浪漫主义的滤镜

"The most surprising aspect of the comparison [of the two contexts] will be the realization that Bach and Handel, whom we regard from our contemporary vantage point as beginning, were regarded more as enders in their own day: outstanding late practitioners of styles and genres that were rapidly growing moribund in their time.

It was their <font color="red">"conservativism"</font> paradoxically enough,that made them canonical.

可以说，有一种极繁主义。

"At a time when many composers were pruning and simplifying their styles in the interests of directness of expression, Bach remained faithful to an older esthetic tradition, seeking instead a **maximum of formal extension and textual complexity**. Through his life he was famed for the **density** of his music—sometimes praised for it, sometimes mocked."

其厚重和深刻，使当时的人不喜欢。

"With Bach the situation was more complicated [than Handel]. He came back into circulation, and achieved a posthumous status he never enjoyed in life, because the conservative aspects of his style, in particular, his very dense **contrapuntal textures** and **his technique of 'spinning out' melodic phrases of extraordinary length**—made his music seem weighty and profound at a time when the qualities of <font color="red">weightiness</font> and <font color="red">profundity</font> were returning to fashion."

不朽的神话

A methodology grew up around Bach, according to which his music had a unique quality that lifted it above the historical flux and made it a **timeless** standard: the greatest music ever written and the greatest music that would or could ever be written.

在当时，Telemann更加有名。例如Sonata in D major, TWV 44:1 - Bremer Barockorchester

> One of the Leipzig municipal councilors grumbled that since the best men could not be had, they would have to make do with a mediocrity. Bach, for his part, felt he had been forced to take a step down the social ladder by going from a Kapellmeister's position at Cöthen to a cantorate [cantor] at Leipzig ([after Johann Kuhnau]). Until age put him out of the running, he repeated sought better employment elsewhere… **However, Leipzig was the best he could do and Bach was the best that Leipzig could do. Neither was very happy with the other**.

Handel是一位企业实业家，重视听众，Bach一生都在小城市求职，家族中有85位音乐家，仿佛命运都被定好。

> Bach was **quintessential provincial career**-humble, unglamorous, workaday. He remained for life in the musical environment to which he had been born, and which Handel quitted at his earliest opportunity. Handel had an unprecedented, self-made, **entrepreneurial career** that brought him glory and a very modern kind of personal fulfillment. Bach's, by contrast, was entirely **predefined**: it was the most traditional of careers for a musician of his habitat and class. For a musician of exceptional talent it was downright confining.

"Toward the end of his Weimar period, Bach set about collecting his <font color="red">chorale preludes</font> into a liturgical cycle that would cover the whole year's services. He had only inscribed 46 items out of a projected 164 in this manuscript, called the Orgelbüchlein ("Little organ book"), when he was called away to Cöthen."



实际上，牧歌主义在这里（J.S. Bach, *Durch Adams Fall ist ganz verderbt*, BWV 637）也有体现。因为脚键盘中有许多大跳，是为了模仿自然音效。

Johann Sebastian Bach, *Ein' feste Burg ist unser Gott*, BWV 720 (chorale prelude, Mühlhausen, 1709) Simon Preston, organ

其实Bach并非写此体裁的第一人，前辈Dieterich Buxtehude (1637-1707)也写过, *Durch Adams Fall ist ganz verderpt* BuxWV 183 | zondag Sexagesimä

Bach Hymnbook 67: *Durch Adams Fall ist ganz verderpt*（亚当的堕落毁灭了我们）

脚键盘变得独立，经常做大跳下行。Pedal is treated as wholly *obbligato*, as an independent voice.

## Toccata and Fugue

最早是Dieterich Buxtehude (1637-1707)把两种矛盾的体裁结合。Toccata in Fugue in F, BuxWV 157

J.S. Bach, Toccata (and Fugue) in F major BWV 540; I. Allegro

其特别之处在于，整个西方音乐史上，这首曲子中让脚踏板先一直踏下不干事；然后手上工作一段时间后再停止，由脚键盘弥补刚刚的空缺进行演出。

> [!NOTE]
>
> 回忆：Toccata一开始就是一种Prelude，Bach也有写过Prelude and Fugue，稍有区别。
> Bach was the latest and greatest exponent of the prelude-and-fugue form.

把十二平均律中的各键盘律制都弹一遍。*Das wohltemperirte Clavier, The Well-Tempered Keyboarde*: "Praeludia und Fugen durch alle Tone und Semitonia'
(Preludes and Fugues through all the Tones and Semitones)，从BWV846到BWV869.

1722（Cöthen），1738-1742（Leipzig）

原因是当时的纯律和五度相生律不能很好地处理转调

> "The whole history of tuning has been one of compromise between **natural resonance** and **practical utility**. Since musical practice almost always demanded the ability to move from key to keyand since the musical practice of the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries suddenly demanded the ability to do this with increasing freedom and variety within single pieces, it was precisely then that the idea of **equalizing the semitones decisively overcame the long-standing resistance of fastidious musicians who objected to the total loss of undeniably beautiful 'pure' fourths, fifths, and thirds**.

一开始Fischer也写过，但Bach立志超越之。"Bach surpassed Fischer by completing the full representation of keys and expanding the scope and the contrapuntal density"

> Ariadne musica is a collection of organ music by Johann Caspar Ferdinand Fischer, first published in 1702. The main part of the collection is a cycle of 19 preludes and fugues in different keys, so Ariadne musica is considered an important precursor to J. S. Bach's The Well-Tempered Clavier, which has a similar structure.

### <font color="red">Prelude</font>

a genre or form that introduces another movement; it typically develops
<font color="green">sharply defined gestural</font> and harmonic patterns, as if exploring a musical idea or technique

Prelude No.1 in C major BWV 846，同时受到prelude和broken [chord] style的影响。

在Prelude No.1 in C minor BWV 847中，又有一定Toccata的段落式(multi-sectional toccata)的痕迹。比如，里面规定了快板、慢板的段落。

### <font color="red">Fugue</font>（前身：<font color="red">Ricecare</font>）

a genre or form in which two or more voices state a subject in **imitative** counterpoint, often with free counterpoint to fill out the texture (<font color="red">exposition, 呈示部</font>); after all voices have entered, statements of the subject alternate with developmental episodes that explore elements of the subject or present new material.

用于提前展示在乐曲中会有的几个声部。

### Devices or Operations:

常用技巧：stretto（密接合应，前一声部主题还没结束，后一声部插入，使声部变得dense）, inversion（倒影）, <font color="red">diminution & augmentation</font>, retrograde（逆行）.

"C. P. E. Bach [Bach's son] recalled that when listening to an organist improvise, or even when hearing a composed fugue for the first time, his father would always try to predict all the devices that could be applied to the subject, taking special pleasure in being surprised by one that he had failed to predict, and, contrariwise, reproaching the player or composer if his expectations went unmet."

在整套的最后一首Fugue No.24 in B minor, BWV 869中，使用了各种半音，表现他对十二平均律的掌握和对位法在数学上的完美。

"Clearly, Bach's art had a Janus face（双面脸）. Formally and textually it looked back to what were even then archaic practices. In terms of harmony and tonally articulated form, however, it was at the cutting edge. That cutting edge still pierces the consciousness of listeners today and calls forth an intense response, while the music of every other Lutheran cantor of the time has perished from the actual repertory.

## Passacaglia and Fugue

虽然Fugue前身是Ricercar，但是Bach自己的改编，使Fugue变成地道的德国风格，而非意大利风格的附属。

例：J.S. Bach, Passacaglia (and Fugue) in C minor, BWV 582 (Weimar, ca. 1708-13)

Well-tempered Clavier

Goldberg Variations (Nürnberg, ca. 1741)，其中变奏的原则就是Chaccone。

## Bach's Dance' Suites（组曲） and Concertos

Despite the seemly cloistered insularity of his career, Bach mastered <font color="red">all range of contemporary musical idoms</font>. In part this was simply a matter of being German. At a time when French and Italian musicians were mutually suspicious and much concerned with resisting each other's influence, German musicians tended to define themselves as **universal synthesis**, able to select with due discrimination from the musical tastes of various peoples **what is best in each**, producing a mixed taste which may well be called the **German taste**. Bach became its ultimate, most universal, exponent.

### Frescobaldian

Diverse curiose partite, di toccate, canzone, ricercate
(Assorted off-beat toccatas, canzonas, ricercars, and so on)
Dix suittess de clavessin
("'Ten **Suites** for Harpsichord")

> "By century's end [17th century], the French style had become a veritable German fetish, the object of intense envy and adaptation. Envy played an important role because it was envy of the opulent French court on the part of the many petty German princelings that led to the wholesale adoption of French manners by the German aristocracy. **French actually became the court language of Germany, and French dancing became an obligatory social grace at the many mini-Versailleses that dotted the German landscape**."

### Froberger's Model

Orchestral <u>Overture</u> Suite
Dance Suite: *Le journal de printems*, 1695
Jahann Caspar Ferdlound Fischer. 1656-1746, a Gillicizer
Harpsichord Suite
Dance Suite: *Musicalisches Blumen-Büschlein*, 1696

为什么Bach能学到很多法国风格的东西？其前辈很多法国通。也有很多人写过法国组曲。他们建立了德语区自己的法国组曲风格。

> Froberger's publication and Fischer's managed to establish a standard suite format that provided the model for all their German or German-born successors.
>
> <font color = "red">Froberger's contribution</font> was the truly fundamental one: it was he who adopted a **specific sequence of four dances as essential nucleus in all his suites**, setting a precedent that governed the composition of keyboard suites from them on. It is worth emphasizing that Froberger's core dances had pretty much gone out of actual ballroom use. They had been sublimated into clevated courtly <font color = "red">listening-music</font> by the master instrumentalists of France, which meant slowing them down and cramming them full of interesting musical detail chat would have been lost on dancers.
>
> Ordre: Order?这是Couperin自称的，但相对于德系，实在难称为有秩序。
>
> Couperin's is a 'set' rather a suite because, following traditional French practice, the pieces in it, while related by key, are too **numerous** to be played or heard on one sitting and are not place in performance order. One fashioned one's own style from such a set *ad libitum*.

其风格是：从其中挑出其中核心组曲（而不像Couperin那样混合），分为主要舞曲和次要舞曲。以及，从他们开始，舞曲不再要伴舞了，而是强化其作为聆听的音乐方面。

### 固定好的风格和顺序

Binary From: A A B B

1. Allemande（阿勒曼德舞曲）
2. Courante（库朗特舞曲）
3. Sarabande（萨拉班德舞曲）
4. Gigue（吉格舞曲）

> "Bach never went to France. Instead, France came to him through the musical publications that circulated widely in the Gallicized musical environment that was Germany. Bach made his most thorough assimilation of the French style when he was professionally required to do so. That was in 1717, when he left Weimar for the position of Kapellmeister in Cöthen. Prince Leopold Anhalt-Cöthen was a passionate musical amateur. He vasa Calvinist（加尔文主义), which meant he had no use for elaborate composers church music or fancy organ playing. So Bach had no calls to compose or play in church and could devore all his time to satisfying his patron's demands for musical entertainment."

此人不喜欢教堂音乐，但是会听世俗音乐。所以在这里工作的时间里，Bach没有写什么教堂音乐，但是写了很多王子想听的舞曲等。

Bach只写过以下几种体裁：

- Sonatas
- Concertos
- Suites
- (orchestra *overtures*, for keyboard, for violin, cello, and lute)

为什么没有歌剧？很大可能是Leipzig的听众不喜欢听。

刚刚说过，红色的主要组曲顺序不能变。且Gigue一定要在最后。蓝色的次要组曲则可以插入在中间。（倒是有一个反例，在BWV 1004中用蓝色的chaccone结尾，打破了一定要用gigue结尾的惯例）

## J.S. Bach's Concertos

### Stadtpfeiferei (town pipers) (tower music)

"The use of brass and percussion unit is the furst level of stylistic admixture, for the virtuoso brass ensemble was a fixture of German municipal music-making. Leipzig was one of the greatest centers for municipal music."

- Ouverture
    <font color="red">Air</font>
    Gavotte I & II
    Bourrée
    Gigue

>  "The bracing composition, usually called the "Italian Concerto" in English, is a tour de force for composer and performer alike. The compositional feat is the transfer to a single keyboard instrument of the whole complex Italian concertato style, with its interplay of solo and tutti. A single keyboard instrument is not a single keyboard: large harpsichords, like pipe organs, had double keyboards that controlled different sets of strings. By engaging a device called a coupler that made both keyboards respond to a single touch, Bach could achieve a solo/tutti contrast between keyboards."

> "Bach's invigorating keyboard arrangement of an <font color="red">imaginary</font> Italian violin concerto was preceded by many keyboard arrangements of actual concertos. While at Weimar. Bach arranged some 19 Iralian concertos:

*Italian Concerto*, BWV 971，但是却只给键盘乐演出。（把本应该有的管弦乐器的功能移植到键盘上）

>  "Making these arrangements is undoubtedly how Bach gained his
>  mastery not only of the trappings of the Italian style but of the
>  driving Italianate harmonic practices that he took so much further
>  than his models, marking him as not just an imitator but a potent
>  and very **idiosyncratic emulator**."

> "By creating his unique and unsuspected joining of what were normally separate entities, Bach knew how to **make the familiar newly strange**. As a self-conscious artistic tendency, such an aim is usually thought to be quintessentially **'modern'; it sits oddly with Bach's reputation as an old-fashioned composer**. And yet his way of uniting within himself both the superannuated and the unheard-of was perhaps Bach's crowning synthetic' achievement."

评价为又保守又现代。

## A fusion of French, Italian, and German styles

*Brandenburg Concertos*

> "Bach hoped for an appointment to Brandenburg's court in Berlin. Indeed, several of Bach's best known compositions, in fact, were written or assembled in connection with job-or title-hunting, often unsuccessful; they include his B minor Mass."

求职曲，title是拿到了，但是工作没有。原因：

1. Margrave never acknowledged receipt of the manuscript (the concertos were never performed)
2. To the Margrave the concertos seemed bizarre, and they were most likely quite unsuited to the resources of his court, for in their scoring chey all differ radically from one another, and not one of them uses a standard orchestral complement.

其中每一首的独奏乐器都不一样，且每一个乐手都应该掌握应有的能力（6首都是大协奏曲）。这体现了宫廷的能力。

Concerto No.5 in D major, BWV 1050

- transverse flute
- violin
- harpsichord（绝对主角，且有炫技段）

<font color="red">Cadenza!</font>

The ealiest of all solo keyboard concertos! 可以认为是钢琴协奏曲的祖师爷。

The unimaginably lengthy passage for the *cembalo solo sense stromenti* (the harpsichord alone without [the other] instruments) is an absolutely unique event in the "High Baroque" concerto repertory.

The final movement of the Fifth Brandenburg Concerto is an excellent example of 'fused' genres. It seems to have a hard time deciding whether it is a **fugue, a gigue, or a concerto**. But of course it is all of those things at once.

在*Brandenburg Concerto No. 6 in B-flat major*, BWV 1051里，用了Viola da gamba，完全没有小提琴。

## Bach's Cantatas（康塔塔）and Passions（受难曲）



*Gottes Zeit ist die allerbeste Zeit*, Canta BWV 106 (*Actus tragicus*) Sonatina (opening sinfonia) Mühlhausen, ca. 1708

- (a) Sonatina
- (b) *Gottes Zeit ist die allerbeste Zeit* (Chorus)
- (c) *Ach, Herr, Lebre uns bedenken* (Arioso)
- (d) *Bestelle dein Haus* (Aria)
- (e) *Es ist er alte Bund* (Chorus und arioso)

Bach's vocal music is actual church music.

>  "In Bach's overtly religious vocal music we shall see Bach's religious <font color="blue">contempt for the world</font> was often communicated through the outward forms of <font color="red">secular entertainment</font>.

> "By the time of Bach's Leipzig tenure even the music of the **Lutheran church** had made an accommodation with the music of the popular theater, and this new style of **theatricalize music** became Bach's medium. Even though he never wrote an opera and maintained a life-long disdain of what he called the pretty little Dresden tunes, Bach became a master of **operatic forms** and devices. But he managed to **subvert them**."

> "Traditionally, Lutheran church music had been based on <font color="red">chorales</font>. By the 1680s a <font color="red">Lutheran '**oratorio**' style</font> had been developed, in which chorales alternated with biblical verses and with little poems that reflected emotionally on the verses the way arias reflected on the action in an *opera seria*."

> "Around the turn of the century [18th-century], Neumeister began publishing little oratorio texts in a new style, for which he borrowed the name of the Italian genre that had inspired him. Consisting entirely of vividly picturesque '<font color="red">madrigalesque</font>' verses, and explicitly divided into <font color="red">recitatives</font> and arias [da capo arias], they were dubbed '<font color="red"><u>cantatas</u></font>' by their author, and they provided the prototype for hundreds of church compositions by Bach."

Händel所写的Oratorio清唱剧很像Bach写的cantatas，只不过清唱剧面向的是世俗，cantatas是宗教的。两者都有牧歌主义。

定义：

**Cantatas**

<font color="red">Cantatas were reflective, not dramatic works</font>. The singers of the arias were not characters but disembodied persons who voiced the idealized thoughts of
the congregation in response to the occasion that had brought them together.
The <font color="red" size=4><u>Lutheran cantata</u></font> could be viewed as a sort of musical sermon, and its placement in the service confirms this analogy.



Bach: *Nun Komm, der Heiden Heiland*, BWV 62, 1724

- (a) No.1, Chorus, *Nun Komm, der Heiden Heiland*
- (b) No.2, Aria (tenor): *Bewundert, o Menschen*
- (c) No.3, Recitative (bass): *So geht aus Gottes Herrlichkeit und Thron*
- (d) No.4, Aria (bass): *Streite, siege, starker Held!*
- (e) No.5 Accompanied recitative (soprano and alto): *Wir ehren diese Herrlichkeit*
- (f) No.6, Chorale: *Lob seit Gott, dem Vater, ton*

其中以No.1 为例，Ritornello 1-5分别接Solo，Ritornello-Solo（Episode）



Undoubtedly Bach's most splendid cantata was BWV 80, written at Leipzig for performance on the Feast of the Reformation, 31 October 1724. This work takes its name from *Ein' fest Burg* ("A mighty fortress"), Luther's most famous chorale.

> "Bach's settings are pervaded with a general **anti-humanism** such as
> we encountered in the Brandenburg Concertos, with their implied religiously motivated contempt for human hierarchies and power relations. The contempt is much more overt in the cantatas and shows up precisely in Bach's seeming **<u>unconcern for practical performance considerations</u>**. A work like Cantata no. 80, plausibly beyond the capabilities of the performers to whom it was perforce assigned, could be looked upon as **'idealistic' in this sense, deliberately contriving a splendor and suggesting a perfection beyond terrestrial accomplishment**."

<font color="red">Bach: *Ein feste Burg*, BWV 80, 1715-1716; 1728-1730s</font>

"Bach's church music sometimes is about '<font color="red">truth</font>' instead of'<font color="red"> beauty</font>'. Some of Bach's most striking works were written to persuade us that the world is filth and horror, that humans are helpless, that life is pain, and that reason is a snare. When the world of man rather than that of God was his subject, he could write music that for sheer, deliberate ugliness. The daring it took to write such passages is perhaps the best testimony to Bach's unique genius."

> "**Undermining human agency** is something that Bach engineers again and again. Unlike Handel's music, Bach's church music serves the purposes of the performers with a dilemma: either adapt the performance to the tastes of the modern secular audience (whether by modernizing the  performing forces, for example, or by '<font color="red">secularizing</font>' the tempos or the general demeanor) and risk losing the full force of the expressive message encoded in the music, or perform the music in an appropriate manner and risk perplexing, fatiguing, or even insulting the audience. This is why only a handful of Bach's cantatas can be said to have really joined the modern performance repertory, and thoroughly unrepresentative handful at that."

Bach所要的速度、残缺的乐器在现在看来都是问题，当它作现代化演绎时，势必变得世俗化。

即contatas虽然是宗教的，演出时变得世俗化。

Bach's B minor Mass, BWV 232 (1749)

> "Bach's best known religious pieces are the ones most comparable to Handel's oratorios and to even later, Catholic religious music. They include two **Passion** settings, one based on the Gospel of <font color="red">**Matthew**</font> and the other on the Gospel of <font color="red">**John**</font>. Paradoxically speaking, they [these religious pieces] include a grandiose concerted setting, for chorus in as many as eight parts and an exceptionally variegated orchestra, of the <font color="red">Latin Mass</font> [<font color="red">**the Mass in B minor**</font>]. a text for which there was no liturgical use at all in the Lutheran church."

> "The Mass is cast in a mixture of styles that reflects its miscellaneous origins. Some of the choruses, although never without an elaborate instrumental accompaniment, are written in a deliberately archaic style that comes closer than ever to the official Catholic <font color="red">*stile antico*</font>; some of the arias, by contrast, are cast in the kind of showy, courtly ('galant'), somewhat<font color="red"> operatic</font> idiom that Bach associated with Dresden."

拉丁文写就。最开始的目的之一是迎合Dresden，为了拿到头衔。严格按照拉丁弥撒格式，Kyrie（垂怜经）、Gloria（荣耀经）、Credo（信经）、Sanctus（圣哉经）和Agnus Dei（羔羊经）。

> "The Catholic electoral court at **Dresden**, in fact, seems to have been the original destination of the Mass, or at least of the **Kyrie** and **Gloria**, which Bach sent in 1733 to the newly ascended Elector, Friedrich August II, who also reigned as the titular king of Poland. Friedrich August was already a notable patron of the arts, from whom Bach was now seeking a favor--not a job but a title (Hofkomponist) that would entitle him to better treatment and higher pay from the Leipzig town council. Bach eventually did receive the title but not until 1736, after sending another petition.. After Bach retired from Leipzig, he added to the Mass a **Sanctus** he had partly composed as early as 1724 and assembling from parodies a **Credo** and an **Agnus Dei**, he turned the Mass into a kind of testamentary piece—a summary of all types of ecclesiastical composition unified by the ancient Latin text of the Mass, <font color="red">but far too long and elaborate to have been intended for actual performance anywhere</font>.

一开始没有演出。Performance began only when Bach has been assimilated to secular form in the 19th century.

**The B minor Mass and Passions were the works through which Bach was 'rediscovered' and reclaimed for the performing repertoire in the nineteenth century.** 正是弥撒和受难曲使得在19世纪的Bach再发现风潮中，他一举被捧上神坛。

The first aria ("Laudamus te"), for the second soprano, sets words of praise in an ingratiatingly ornate and courtly chamber style. The ritornello is a veritable violin concerto, and the vocal writing, with its trills and roulades, is as close to a castrato idiom as Bach ever came.

他写了两部受难曲集。

1. The original Gospel text: recitative
2. Narrator（受难曲中，经常有一个评论者在局外，对于事迹做评说。）
3. Solo voices (direct discourses spoken directly by the "actors, voice
    persona"
4. Chorus (people)

巴赫复兴、再发现，很大程度上归功于门德尔松（Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, 1809-1847）。

> "That fair copy passed into Carl Friedrich Zelter's possession and provided the vehicle for Bach's rediscovery and canonization as a musical Founding Father when the 20 year old Felix Mendelssohn, a pupil of Zelter who would have a distinguished carer as composer in his own right, conducted a performance of the *St. Matthew Passion* at the Berlin Singakademie on 11 March 1829, a little over a century after its first performance in Leipzig."

The very aspects of Bach's style had led to his temporary eclipse: **complexity**, **conservatism**, **uncompromising religiosity**, and **asperity**. 

<font size =5>"Excess of Art" and "Turgid and Confused Style"</font>

浪漫主义偏好抽象、宏大的作品。

The nineteenth-century Bach revival focused mainly on just a few works: <font color="red">the Passion oratorios</font>, the <font color="red">B-minor Mass</font>, the <font color="red">Well-Tempered Clavier</font>, and a few later masterworks of an old-fashioned, abstract nature in which Bach gave full rein to his unrivaled contrapuntal virtuosity. This last group included of <font color="red">*Goldberg Variations*</font>, a huge cycle of 30 keyboard pieces, including a series of intricate canons, all based on a single 'aria' (ostinato). The ultimate "speculative" work, Bach's intended final testament, was <font color="red">*Die Kunst Der Fuge* ("The Art of Fugue", BWV 1080)</font>. Bach was working on this collection on the day he died.

同时，也与德意志民族国家认同的形成有关。

>"The specific nature of German nationalism also favored Bach's  anonization. Where the British prided themselves on their commerce and industry, and on their liberal political institutions, the Germans, then lacking political unity, very backward industrially, and economically ruined by the Napoleonic wars, prided themselves on 'art and learning. Their nationalism was a nationalism of culture. As Carl Kossmaly expressed: "in the realm of ideas" "in everything concerning intelligence and spiritual capacity, not only inner unity and national independence but also a decided superiority must be granted to the Germans. In music, Bach was the proof. His profundity and complexity were all of a sudden national treasures; and the abstract musical speculations of his late years became harbingers of 'absolute music; the highest of all the arts, were the German most vehemently asserted their supremacy.

十八世纪末至十九世纪初德国音乐理论家和音乐史家Johann Nikolaus Forkel还有一本书**《复调：巴赫与生命之恸》**专门介绍。

## Early Classical Styles: Music from the 1730s to the 1760s

### Galant Style（优雅风格）：

"Galant style music is a light, elegant, and free homophonic style of composition that was popular in the 18th century. It was a reaction to the Baroque eras serious fugal style, and was characterized by its focus on **melody**, **simplicity**, and **clarity**."

与Bach相反，强调小而美，是对严肃复调风格的反补，有呼吸的空间

| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| (1) Melodies were modeled on or even borrowed from folk song and folk dance to assure immediate and popular appeal; the more difficult (and poignant) melodic intervals were increasingly climinated, while rhythmic patterns, often adopted from dance types, were enlivened with snappy syncopations or more frequent mixtures of longer and shorter note-values. | 民间风格的旋律 |
| (2) The rich harmonic vocabulary of the late Baroque style was substantilly reduced, relieved especially of its most intense and expressive combinations, while at the same time the rate of harmonic change — the harmonic rhythm — was slowed down. | 放慢和声节奏   |
| (3) More complex polyphonic and imitative textures were discarded in favor of a melody-dominated setting in which the bass part relinquished independent melodic interest and contented itself with the most unassuming thumping of repeated notes and similar patterns; and the middle parts often became totally inconsequential or disappeared altogether. | 主调音乐风格   |
| (4) Finally, the long, freely spun-out, and seemingly irrational melodic arches and arabesques characteristic of the late Baroque style (a product of the recent development of instrumental and vocal virtuosity and the old art of improvisation) were replaced by clearly articulated and almost arithmetically balanced phrases- a method of organization imported mainly from the dance genres. This was only secondarily a revision of melodic style; it was mainly a redefinition of the principles of musical form itself. <br />Marshall, Bach the Progressive," 330. | 对称均衡的乐句 |

Bach the progressive: Bach也学习过此种风格。如Prelude in C-sharp major, BWV 872.（不过也加入了Fugue）

### Examples of the preclassic or galant style in Bach's music

- Cantata 51, *Jauchzet Gott in allen Landen* ("Praise God in all lands;
    September 17, 1730?)
- Mass in B Minor (Kysie and Gloria), 1733
- Goldberg Variations (*Klavierübung* IV, ca. 1742)
- Cantata 201, *Geschwinde, geschwinde, ihr wirbelnden Winde*
    ("The Contest between Phoebus and Pan, 1729-30)
- Cantata 209, *Non sa che sia dolore*
- Coffee Cantata (1734-35)
- Peasant Cantata (1742, the last datable cantata)

## Scarlatti

Bach lived his life in defiance of the **Enlightenment** and was revived in reaction to it. The remaining member of the class of 1685, Domenico Scarlatti exemplified the esthetic of Enlightenment better, perhaps, than any other musician of his time.

"An Imaginative, Isolated, Pampered Genius"

Virtuoso Harpsichordist，只写给自己。

其想法是"Ingenious Jesting with Art": delighting the listener，以丑角的方式娱乐观众

**550 Keyboard: Sonatas: Single movements: 单乐章Sonatas，每一章短小精悍，与多乐章的流行相反**

"Although preferring to provide delight in single short dose, unlike Couperin, Scarlatti liked to make brash statements as well as tender ones. Lilke any jester（弄臣)，he had an exhibitionistic streak.

用到的技巧：

1. 跨手Virtuosity (crossing hands, glissando)
2. Harmonic Extravagance (chromaticism)
3. Fantastic Variety of a Single Basic Idea
4. Exotic Local Color（指的是西班牙风味）

Scarlatti, Sonata G, K 105 (Jeno Jando)

加入了吉他扫弦技巧（吸取了西班牙风格）和Acciaccaturas (crush)：碎音（二度音程），创造一连串不协和的效果。

在曲目中，Scarlatti经常用快速的持续音（可能用多个手指弹），以及大跳。

"D. Scarlatti surely was one of the latest bloomers among the major names in music history. He only came into his own as a composer in 1738, with the publication of his furst book Essercizi pergravicembalo. By then the class of 1685 were all aged fifty-three, and Bach' and Handel's careers were largely behind them. Scarlatti was just beginning to be 'Scarlatti', and this **his effective starting point coincided with Bach's and Handel's finish lines. As a composer, then, Scarlatti might better be regarded not as a contemporary of J. S. Bach but rather as an elder member of the generation of Bach's sons**."

Mozart: "Bach ist der Bater, wir Sind die Buden"（巴赫如我的父亲一般），应该是指巴赫的其中一个儿子。因为老Bach已经是其爷爷辈了。

其中有才的两位，分别是同父异母。

Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach (1714-88) 和 Johann Christian Bach (1727-1788)

> "**C. P. E. Bach** (1714-1788) and his much younger half-brother J. C. Bach (1735-82) was indeed regarded by the musician of the late eighteenth century as a **founding father**. Their eminence has much receded, though, owing to the historical circumstances that attended the rise of the modern
> "classical' repertory and the writing of its history. That modern repertory began with the works of **Mozart** himself and his contemporaries, notably **Franz Joseph Hayda**. When J. S. Bach was revived in the nineteenth century, he was appended to an already-established 'canon' of works and, along with Handel, was proclaimed its **founding father**. The work of his sons however, was not revived."

相比于老巴赫等人，他的名声可谓大器晚成，反而和巴赫儿子同时期闻名。

> "The **false genealogy** thus implied, in which the generation of Bach and Handel was cast in a direct line that led straight to the generation of Haydn and Mozart, was responsible for a host of false historical assumptions. Because of them [J. S. Bach and Handel], The interest and attention of historians was diverted away from the music and the musical life of the <font color="red">mid-eighteenth century</font>, when the Bach sons, along with the later composers were at their height of activity and prestige.

> "No period is in greater need of fundamental research than the period that extended from the <font color="red">1730s to the 1760s</font>: the period, in other words, in which the composers born in the first two decades of the century dominated the contemporary scene. This period lonely commonly known as '<font color="red">**Preclassic**</font>' has been until recently the most systematically neglected span of years in the whole history of European 'fine-art' music.

1730-1760年，他儿子比较活跃，也是新风格出现的时期。此时期称为<font color="red">前古典</font>，也代表<font color="red">late Baroque</font>。

然后老Bach还有一个大儿子……叫Wilhelm Friedemann Bach，对比他和老爸写的长笛奏鸣曲，有诸多不同。

> "J. S. Bach never dreamt of writing keyboard sonatas like WF's. The stylistic and rhetorical gulf is the mind-boggler. Imitative counterpoint is an occasional device, more a decorative touch than the essential modus operandi. The most basic difference lies in the melodic design. At the opposite pole from J. S. Bach's powerfully spinning engine, is based on he dual principle of short-range contrast and balance.

1. 主调，有主旋律。
2. 构成旋律的材料更为丰富，且更为短小。
3. 不定期终止，给人呼吸的空间。
4. 这几点，Handel和老Bach都没有用过。

"Every distinctive feature of the son's style-<u>its melodic profigacy</u>(挥霍), <u>its reliance on the **contrast and balance of short ideas**, its frequent cadences, its self-dramatizing form its synergistic harnessing of melodic and harmonic events</u>, even its characteristic melodic and harmonic rhythms--were absolutely antithetical to his father's style, and to Handel's as well."

在旋律的使用可谓挥霍，而且又多又短小，之间有强烈的对比，在不同的概念之间需要终止式和休息。由于旋律多，主和弦若播放了形态A，之后和声也可以在属和弦内用形态A，这样主旋律和和声更加配合。

例如： W.A. Mozart, Sinfonie in C (Jupiter-Sinfonie) KV 551

儿子们的风格不可预测，另外一个儿子(C. P. E. Bach)有着善感风格，常有人把他称为浪漫主义的始祖。

**Unpredictability in Melodic Designs:**
A quick, spontaneous responsiveness or changeability of mood
<font color="red">*Empfindsamkeit*</font> (sensibiling)
*empfindsamer Stil* (sentimental, sensitive style)

### 善感风格

强调主观感受，而非单纯的客观概念，是一种极具个人色彩、自恋型表现主义的美学态度。

可能来源于其邻居 Fredrich Gottlieb Klopstock (1724-1803)，是一个诗人。一开始为诗谱曲，后来不满足于此，逐渐脱胎成为一种独立的风格。

> "This was a new aesthetics, which aimed not at **objective depiction** of a character's feelings, as in an opera, but at the expression and transmission of **one's own**; and, being based on introspection, it was 'realistic' in the sense that it recognized the skittishness and fluidity of **subjective** feeling.

> "Composers of the *empfindsamer Stil*, composing on a much smaller scale for intimate domestic surroundings, sought to capture the way "**real people**" really felt. They sought to create an impression of self-portraiture in which the player of their music would recognize a corresponding **self-portrait**.

> "C. P. E. Bach set Klopstock's odes to music and carried on a lively and sympathetic correspondence with him about the relationship of music and poetry. He was in effect a musical Klopstock and the chief representative in his own medium of artistic *Empfindsamkeit*. The term is now firmly associated with him, and with his keyboard music in particular."
>
> "It is quite possible for a person to have studied composition with good success and to have turned his pen to fine ends without his having any gift for improvisation. But, on the other hand, a good future in composition can be assuredly predicted for anyone who can improvise, provided that he writes profusely and does not start too late."
>
> - C. P. E. Bach, *Essy on the True Art of Playing Kryboard Instruments* (1753)
>
> "It is important for us to realize that C. P. E. Bach is describing not only a style of performance but a style of composition as well. The kind of <font color="red">mercurial changeability of mood</font> he emphasizes, and the impetuous <font color="red">sincerity</font> he demands of the player, would both be out of place in a work by his father or in a formalized array by Handel."

他要求changeability和sincerity都要有，是two aesthetic concept，即情绪变化快，且是真诚的。

### Stylistic Technics: Recitative

借用了宣叙调

1. Refined Passion and Melancholy
2. Ornamentation (Expression)
3. Constantly Changing Rhythm
4. Sudden Changes in Harmony, Dynamic, Texture, or others
5. Unpredictability
6. Sequential Repetition
7. Chromaticism

C.P.E. Bach个人更喜欢用clavichord（古钢琴），是钢琴的前身。

Domenico Scarlatti, Sonata in B minor, K. 27

"C. P. E. Bach did not use the word empfindsamer to describe his style. His term for this inoculate, pressing idiom, with its rhythmic indefiniteness and harmonic waywardness, was the "**fantasia**" style.

Unlike J. S. Bach, C. P. E. Bach regarded *fantasia* as freestanding, complete compositions.

强调幻想曲。他儿子视为一种独立存在的作品（其实是伪即兴）。老Bach也会写，只不过一定会加入赋格。

> "C. P. E. Bach's aim was to **transcend texts**—that is, to achieve a level of pure expressivity that language, bound as it was to semantie specifies, could never reach. This transcendently expressive music of which C. P. E. Bach was the fully self-conscious harbinger was later dubbed "absolute music". It marked the furst time that instrumental music was deemed to have decisively surpassed vocal music in spiritual content, and to be consequently more valuable as art.

虽然一开始与歌词有关，中期也有人试图为他谱曲，但他一直认为要超越文字本身，是“绝对音乐”的概念。

-------

"J. C. Bach followed a career, completely at variance with his fathers...His main teacher was his half brother C. P. E. Bach In 1755, aged nineteen, he made the fateful trip to Italy. Later he found himself a patron in a Milanese count; and in 1760 he became an organist at Milan Cathedral, having first converted to Catholicism in order to qualify for the job. During the same year he wrote his first *opera seria*... In 1762, J. C. Bach received an invitation to compose for the King's Theatre in London, Handel's old stamping ground."

J. C. Bach也被称为伦敦巴赫，因为最后也是像亨德尔一样到伦敦工作。中间还去过米兰，改信了天主教。

Bach-Abel Concerts

短小，有对比，多种旋律。

J.C. Bach见过多种Sonata，开创性地写了"Accompanied" Keyboard Sonata，一反常态，用小提琴给钢琴伴奏。（一般人都是反过来）

### "Accompanied' Keyboard Sonata

It was the spirit of *galanterie* that gave rise to what we now call chamber music
(室内乐）in its modern sensc. The frst pieces of this kind grew directly out of
**keyboard sonata**, and it happened first in France. The carliest composers to
attempt the transformation of keyboard sonatas into sociable ensembles were
Parisian violinists.

### Music and Sociability

在作品中，他强调要联系大众。

"All in all, J. C. Bach was the most versatile composer of his generation, turning out music in every contemporary medium and for every possible outlet. His last years were marked by several reverses in fortune and the declining popularity of his music. He died so deeply in debt that it took the queen's intervention to get him decently buried and enable his widow (Italian soprano, Cecilia Grassi] to return home to Italy."

对比两兄弟

> "Stylistically and formally, C. P. E. Bach and J. C. Bach are similar enough, but 'attitudinally' they contrast markedly, C. P. E. Bach is solitary, introspective, inner-directed' music; J. C. Bach's is sociable, outgoing. The former one explores personal, private, even unexpressed feelings; we easily imagine it performed for an audience of one, late at night, in a mood of emotional self-absorption.… the latter is party music, implying bright lights, company, a surtounding hubbub of conversation. That about sums up the difference between *Empfindung* and *galanterie*, and it is no accident that the one word is German and the other French."

C. P. E. Bach活着是为了写音乐，J. C. Bach靠写音乐才能活着。

## The Emergence of Comic Operas（喜歌剧）

连《奥菲欧》中，也有悲喜混杂的要素。

威尼斯听众认为正歌剧太严肃，妥协的结果是在间幕中插入搞笑片段，称为幕间剧。

> "During operas furst century, especially at the public theaters of Venice, it was considered good form to mix serious and comie scenes and characters, producing a kind of heterogeneous 'Shakespearean' drama that afforded audiences the very utmost in varied entertainment.
>
> "Then the reformers got to work. Seeking to restore the dignity of the earliest 'neoclassical' (courtly) operas and justify the genre in light of classical poetic theory, librettists began to regard comic scenes as breaches of taste. Such scenes were banished…But what is kicked out the front door often climbs back in through the window. The public, especially in Venice, was unwilling to give up a favorite operatic treat—nor, more to the point, were they willing to forgo the pleasure of seeing and hearing their favorite buff, many of whom, had large llawings.

### Intermezzos, intermession play/Comic opera

"A curious compromise was reached: the newly standardized *opera seria* remained free of any taint of comedy, but little comic plays with music were shown during the intermissions.

"They were usually in two little acts (parts) to supply the intermissions required by a typical three-act *opera sera*, and almost always featured two squabbling characters, a soprano and a bass, these being the most typical ranges for *buffi*."

后来，幕间剧这种形式大受欢迎，独立出来。

The great masterwork of the intermezzo genre:
*La serva padrona*(The servant mistress”《女僕做夫人》）by
Giovanni Batista Pergolesi(1710-1736).

Pergolesi（此人开创了喜歌剧的体裁）, *Stabat Mater*, 1 "Stabat Mater"，开场是巴洛克味，然后是赋格的声部间模仿。甚至被老Bach重写过第一章。

第四乐章，又是轻快的古典风格。

"The intermezzo quickly became world famous, at first thanks to performances by traveling troupes of *buffi* who within ten years of its fust performance took it all around Italy and as far away as Munich, Dresden, and even Hamburg in the north Germany. By the end of the 1740s it had been heard in Paris, and by the end of the 50s it had conquered London, St. Petersburg, and Madrid."

### La Serva Padrona (The Maid Turned Mistress, Naples, 1733)

Basic plot:

- Part 1: Uberto is a bachelor who complains about his difficult and
    negligent maid, Serpina ("snake"). He asks his servant Vespone
    to find him a submissive wife. Serpina wants to matry Uberto,
    but he refuses. She secretly prevents Vespone from leaving.
- Part 2: Serpina conspires with Vespone: he pretends to be her
    abusive fancé and demands a dowry: picking the lesser of
    two evils, Uberto decides to marry her, after much
    confusion, hesitation, and self-debate. After the tick is
    revealed, Uberto realizes that he in fact loves Serpina.

1. 这与18世纪启蒙运动出现后，高富帅的人可能智商低下，聪明的人可能在低下的阶级里。“王候将相宁有种乎”
2. 婚姻情节当时受欢迎
3. 主仆关系凸显，且一定要主人笨，仆人聪明
4. 从男高音变成男低音唱
5. Happy Ending
6. 唱词特别快，"patter"，比较轻快

Characteristics of *Opera buffa*

1. Upper-class and middle-class characters
2. Domestic scenes and issues: class conflict, marriage, infidelity, seduction
3. Master-servant relationship: Who is smarter—the master or servant?
4. Important voice type: the comic bass (*basso buffo*)
5. Happy endings (marriage, rcconciliation)
6. Rapid vocal parts ("patter"), light textures, appealing melodies,
    ensembles that carry important dramatic action

>     巴赫的《Goldberg变奏曲》在结构上高度对称。原始的“阿里奥索”作为整个作品的主题，展现了平衡与对称，而每一个变奏都基于对主题的巧妙变形和层次递进。在这部作品中，巴赫巧妙地运用了对位法和模仿手法，整个作品充满了深度和精巧的数学美感。在很多变奏中，我们不仅能感受到音乐上的变化，还能领略到他对对位和和声的掌握。
>
> 3. **形式和表达的完美融合**
>     尽管《Goldberg变奏曲》充满了技术上的挑战，巴赫同样关注音乐表达的情感深度和色彩变化。每个变奏都有其独特的气质，从轻松欢快到严肃庄重，从宁静温柔到充满激情，巴赫通过各种音乐技巧将情感和技术完美融合，使得作品不仅仅是一个音乐练习，而是一部完整的艺术作品。
>
> 4. **广泛的音乐影响和多元性**
>     在《Goldberg变奏曲》中，巴赫展示了他对多种音乐风格和技巧的理解和吸收。例如，变奏中的一些卡农和赋格技巧显示了巴赫对意大利、法国以及德意志各地音乐风格的深刻理解。同时，巴赫在作品中通过多种技巧的结合、对位法的运用，形成了其个人独特的音乐语言，这种语言不仅是对巴洛克时期音乐风格的总结，也预示着更深层次的音乐发展。
>
>     1. **德意志风格**：
>         - **复调技法**：巴赫是复调音乐的巨匠，《哥尔德堡变奏曲》中充满了复杂的对位技法，尤其是在变奏部分，他运用了赋格和对位的手法，体现了德意志音乐传统的严谨和深度。
>         - **和声结构**：巴赫在和声的运用上也展示了德意志音乐的特点，使用丰富的和声进行和调性探索，使音乐具有强烈的内在逻辑感。
>     2. **法国风格**：
>         - **舞曲形式**：在某些变奏中，巴赫借鉴了法国的舞曲风格，比如“法兰西小步舞曲”（Sarabande）和“阿尔曼德”（Allemande）。这些舞曲节奏和风格的引入，增加了作品的多样性和风情。
>         - **优雅的旋律**：法国音乐往往强调旋律的优雅和装饰性，巴赫在变奏中也使用了诸多装饰音和细腻的乐句，使得音乐更具法式的优雅和流畅感。
>     3. **意大利风格**：
>         - **意大利协奏曲的影响**：巴赫对意大利协奏曲的形式有深刻的理解和吸收。在《哥尔德堡变奏曲》中，某些变奏展示了快速的音阶、装饰音和对比性的乐段，体现了意大利风格的活力和戏剧性。

>
> ### 结语
>
> 巴赫通过《Goldberg变奏曲》展现了他作为“百科全书家”的深刻性。作品中展示的音乐技巧、结构、形式与情感的结合，无论是在其时代还是今天，都具有跨时代的价值。巴赫不仅在一部作品中融合了大量的音乐技巧和风格，还为后代音乐家提供了广泛的学习和研究范本。他的作品充满了精致的数学结构，同时也承载着丰富的情感表达，这正是巴赫被誉为“百科全书家”的原因之一。

第二题谈前古典期的风格，比如讲对称感强时，要举例作品。

> ### 1. **音乐结构：复杂 vs 简洁**
>
> - **巴赫的复杂结构**：巴赫的音乐作品，尤其是像《马太受难曲》、赋格作品和《Goldberg变奏曲》之类的作品，具有极为复杂的对位技术和多层次的结构。他常使用**赋格（fugue）**、**对位法（counterpoint）**和**变奏（variations）**等技巧，将多个旋律线缠绕在一起，形成精致的和声与结构。例如，在《The Well-Tempered Clavier》（《平均律钢琴曲集》）和《Goldberg变奏曲》中，巴赫利用主题的对位、反向、倒影等方式创建了一种高超的多声部织体。
> - **前古典风格的简洁性**：前古典风格（Galant Style）强调旋律的清晰、流畅与简单，注重直观的情感表达。与巴赫的复杂对位结构不同，前古典风格的作品通常采用**单一旋律线**，并辅以简单的和声进行，强调“即兴”与表演性。例如，**C.P.E.巴赫**、**约翰·克里斯托弗·格拉克**（Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach）和**斯卡尔拉蒂** 550 Keyboard: Sonatas: Single movements等作曲家的作品，都倾向于使用短小的乐句和简洁的和声进行，避免了巴赫式的多声部对位。
>
> ### 2. **对位与和声：多声部织体 vs 和声简化**
>
> - **巴赫的对位技巧**：巴赫是对位艺术的高手，他的作品充满了多声部织体和复杂的和声进行。在他的作品中，各个声部经常独立运行，互相交织，形成复杂的音乐结构。例如，在《赋格的艺术》与《平均律钢琴曲集》中的赋格，声部之间的对位关系往往非常紧密，每个声部都可能成为独立的旋律线，而不是单纯的和声填充。
> - **前古典风格的和声简化**：相对于巴赫的复杂对位，前古典风格更加简洁和直接。和声的使用变得更加清晰和简化，强调的是和弦的简洁进行，避免了巴赫那种层层叠加的对位和复杂的和声延续。例如，在前古典风格的作品中，我们常常可以看到**单一和弦进程**，和声变化较为简单，更多的是通过旋律和节奏的变化来吸引听众的注意力，而非通过复杂的对位法和和声设计。
>
> ### 3. **旋律风格：复杂 vs 简单**
>
> - **巴赫的旋律风格**：巴赫的旋律通常较为复杂，具有丰富的装饰音、快速的音符运动和大量的对位技巧。他的旋律不仅在长短音符的配置上表现出技巧性，而且常常在多声部中同时展开。巴赫的旋律往往充满了对比与张力，伴随着严谨的节奏和复杂的和声结构。如《十二平均律》曲集中，多半是展示作者对于复调的应用。
> - **前古典风格的旋律**：与巴赫的旋律相比，前古典风格的旋律更注重**优雅与流畅**，并倾向于使用简单的、常见的音阶进程。旋律的线条通常更加清晰、直接，节奏上也比巴赫的音乐更为规整，避免了过多的装饰音与复杂的音符跳动。旋律的重心往往更加突出，旋律线条通常较为连贯，避免了复杂的对位与和声层叠。
>
> ### 4. **节奏感与表达：对比与装饰 vs 自然流畅**
>
> - **巴赫的节奏感与表达**：巴赫的作品通常具有强烈的节奏感和对比性，他通过复杂的节奏模式和切分节奏来增强音乐的紧张感与表现力。在许多作品中，巴赫使用了较为复杂的节奏型和对节奏的精确控制，增加了音乐的表达张力。例如，在巴赫的《平均律钢琴曲集 Well-Tempered Clavier》和《Toccata与赋格》中，节奏的自由变化为作品带来了丰富的动力感。
> - **前古典风格的流畅感**：前古典风格则追求更加**流畅和优雅**的节奏感。节奏较为稳定，旋律线条流畅自然，避免了巴赫作品中的复杂节奏结构与对比。前古典风格的节奏变化更多依赖于音乐的情感表达和旋律本身的起伏，而非巴赫式的节奏对比和紧张感。
>
> ### 5. **情感表达：理性与技巧 vs 简单与直观**
>
> - **巴赫的理性与技巧**：巴赫的音乐常常表现出一种理性和技术上的严谨。他通过精细的对位和复杂的结构来传递深刻的情感和思想，音乐的情感通常通过技术手段来加以表述。即使在表现情感时，巴赫的作品也常常维持一种相对复杂的结构，并通过对位、和声的变化来塑造情感的深度。以康塔塔*Ein feste Burg*, BWV 80为例，更注重一种理性的音乐美。
> - **前古典风格的情感直观性**：前古典风格则倾向于更加**直接和直观**的情感表达，注重通过旋律线的简洁和和声的平稳来传递音乐的情感。与巴赫的理性构建不同，前古典风格更侧重于音乐的“优雅”和“美感”，并且避免了过于复杂的技艺表达，使得情感的传递更加直接和自然。
>
> ### 结语
>
> 总的来说，巴赫的音乐代表了巴洛克风格的高度复杂性和技术性，他通过精致的对位法、多声部织体和严密的结构来展示音乐的深度与复杂性。相比之下，前古典风格则倾向于简洁、流畅和直接的表达，追求旋律的优雅与和声的清晰。这两种风格的差异，不仅反映了不同时代音乐思想的变化，也展示了音乐从复杂的理性表达逐渐转向更加直观、情感化的表达方式的过程。

Listen to Pergolesi and Hasse

### War of the Buffons

*Querelle des Buffons*（丑角剧之争）

'"The slightly revised version of La serva padrona was the one brought to Paris. The furor they touched off with their performances, and the debates to which it led, had extraordinary repercussions in the French capital, and in all of its cultural satellites both in France and abroad!"

对于贵族利益有了威胁，因为会有通过婚姻实现的阶级跨越。

"There is no doubt that the motivation for that famous battle was <u>political as well as aesthetic</u>: by attacking the Opéra, a symbol of the self-glorification and chauvinism of the monarchy, <u>the philosophes were firing potshots at the régime under the cover of music criticism</u>."

"Diderot's pamphlet, *Rameau's Nephew*, which has already been quoted, may be viewed as an aftershock of the *Qrerelle des Bafons*(丑角剧之争)。One of the most powerful salvos was fired off by <font color="red">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</font>, in a scathing "Letter on French Music," published in November 1753, which clicited more than thirty rejoinders. Rousseau gave no quarter, **ridiculing the *tragédies lyriques* performed by the royal musical establishment as stilted, labored, devoid of naturalness, ugly in harmony, and ungainly in prosody (text-setting)**. He went so far as to maintain that there was not and could not be such a thing as a truly French opera, for the phrase, he asserted, was a veritable contradiction in terms."

卢梭唯一较有名的歌剧小品：J. J. Rousseau, "J'ai perdu tout mon bonheur" from *Le Devin du Village*

"Despite its implied politics, its catchy tunes even made it a court favorite for while. After hearing it, Louis XV was observed by his palace staff tunelessly humming the opening number for the rest of the day."

"But Rousseau was much more than a musician. His appeal to <font color="red">natural virtue</font> and his denigrations of the traditional musical repertoire of the <font color="blue">royal court</font> were linked: both were veiled expressions of his philosophical and political hostility to the monarchical order."

"For modern style' here, we can read 'modern philosophy between the lines. For the likes of Rousseau and Diderot, the *Querelle des Buffoons* was a covert forum for disseminating the complex of ideas now collectively referred to as 'Enlightened'."

## The Enlightenment and Mozart's Operas

第一次器乐曲和歌剧变得难以分开：

> "Symphonies, concertos, trios, and sonatas—all, nowadays, borrow something from comic opera."
> (Johann Adam Hiller, 1728-1804)

Niccolò Piccinni (1728-1800)：重要，但没人听过。

他听到了来自英国的著作。

**Virtuous maids** fend off or are rescued from lascivious aristocrats. The bar of class is overcome and made and aristocrat find happiness together.

与之前的剧不一样的情况是：本剧中女仆是有道德感的。

从此，喜歌剧的立意也发生了变化。

The eighteenth-century English novel was a celebration of **social mobility**.

与英国的环境也有关，强调市场竞争和阶级流动。

Niccolò Piccinni (1728-1800)
Carlo Osvaldo Goldoni (1707-1793)

两个人写了：

*La buona faliuola* (1760）（《真挚的姑娘》）
(*The Good-Natured Girl* or *The Accomplish'd Maid*), or *La Cecchina* (The girl from Cecchina)

### What made a couple happy?

"The trouble was that an Italian audience would not have found the plot sufficiently believable…The elevation of a poor commoner through marriage was not possible in Italy. According to Italian law, such a marriage would bring about not the ennobling of the commoner but the disgrace and impoverishment of the noble. Goldoni was forced to find another motivation or excuse for the happy marriage. He found it in the device of mistaken identity: Pamela's father turns out to be not a poor schoolteacher but an exiled count, and so she can marry her noble lover with impunity."

但是，意大利本土属于旧欧洲社会，难以像英国一样跨越。为了使剧作合理，设定为女仆父亲是一个没落贵族。

"The emphasis was thus shifted away from the potential distuption of traditional social norm, but the satisfaction of natural love in a happy marriage was nevertheless retained, and the story could still capture the imagination of idealistic lovers. Whereas we may think the device of mistaken identity a threadbare stratagem, in the context of eighteenth-century continental society and its rules, the device made the story more realistic and convincing, not less?"

一开始的爱是无私的，没有财产、阶级的考虑。后来真相、身世是顺带的。

Middle-Class Value: Love not Duty

*Semiseria*（半正歌剧）
("c*omédie larmoyante, tearful comedy*")
"<font color="red">**This work marked the point at which comic opera could begin to surmount the farce situations of the intermezzos and carry a serious or uplifting message of its own**</font>. That serious message was nothing less than a competing set of class aspirations--the aspirations of a <font color="red">self-made class</font> whose power had begun to threaten that of hereditary principle.

"In *semiseria* or 'tearful comedy', the happy end was reached by way of tears and therefore carried **ethical** weight. But instead of the weight of traditional social obligation, it was the weight of an implied injunction to be '**authentic**'. artlessly true to one's **natural feelings**."

<font size = 5>Authentic, Natural Feelings</font>

*La buona faliuola* (1760）（《真挚的姑娘》）
Cecchina: "folk-like" innocence
v.s.
Lucinda: "noble" aspects of music for ignoble person (melismas)

同时，有一个反派女用用正歌剧的华彩花腔唱。

English Bourgeois Ideals
"Aristocratic audiences found the genre insufferable, and it [*Pamela*] quickly becamme just as popular target for lampooning as the *opera seria* had been."

还是有贵族不能接受，因此正歌剧也有所改变。

### How about *Opera Seria*?

就算是正歌剧，改变也是向着自然、本真的方向。

"Although in many ways the [reformed] *opera seria* almost diametrically opposed to the style and the attitude of Piccinni's masterpiece of sentimental
comedy, it embodied a similar infusion of what was know as 'sensibility', It too was in its way a quest for the **'natural**' and the **'authentic'**."

Christoph Willibald Gluck (1714-1787) 是萨列里的老师（莫扎特的对头）

改革正歌剧：

~~Dazling Artifices~~
"When composing, Gluck tried hard to forget that he was a musician. What he meant by that was that he strove to avoid the sort of decorative musicality that called attention to itself—and away from the drama." (Gluck)

**Gluck' Opera Reformation: A Process of Elimination**

1. Vain singers
2. Vain composers
3. Ridiculous spectacles
4. Unnatural paragons
5. Cold morality

*Orfeo ed Euridice*, 1762

Noble simplicity

True Style: Classicism/Antiquity

剧本的改编，强调自我牺牲的伟大气概：

"Where Per's or Monteverdis Orpheus had looked back on Eurydice and lost her again our of sheer weakness, Glucks hero does so out of stoic resolution and strength of character: in response to Eurydice's bewildered entreaties, Orpheus turns and looks to reassure her of his love, even though it means he must lose her. His act, in other words, has been turned into one of noble self sacrifice: the classic *seria* culmination."

Aristocratic Value, High Pathos

这与Jean-Baptiste Lully, *tragédie en musique*强调的悲剧有相似之处。

第一部取消Harpsichord伴奏的就是这部*Orfeo ed Eurydice*

Orpheus's recitative is accompanied by the orchestral strings with all parts written out, not just a figured bass. As a result, *Orfeo ed Eurydice* <u>**became the first opera that can be performed without the use of any continuo-realizing instruments**</u>. There could hardly be any greater reform' of the medium than this.

- [ ] Italian *da capo aria* (ritornello)
- [x] French *rondeau* (periodic vocal refrain)

Too Beautiful?

> I've lost my Eurydice,
> Nothing can equal my sorrow;
> O Cruel fate, what hardship,
> I give myself up to despair.

有人认为调子过于喜悦，仿佛是找到了Eurydice而非失去了。
