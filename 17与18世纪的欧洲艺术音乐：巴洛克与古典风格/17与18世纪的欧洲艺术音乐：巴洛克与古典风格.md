 “巴古”音乐
========

“巴洛克” 的首次出场是在贬义性语境下被用于评价 18 世纪的音乐作品(更具体 一点来说，该词是用来批判拉莫 (Jean-Philippe Rameau, 1683–1764) 于 1733 年创作的歌剧 《希波利特和阿里希》( *Hippolyte et Aricie* )，而非 17 世纪的作品。

“古典”则是19世纪的人指代上世纪的作曲家：海顿 (Joseph Haydn, 1732–1809)、莫扎特 (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, 1756–1791) 与贝多芬 (Ludwig van Beethoven, 1770–1827)。

将老巴赫 (J. S. Bach, 1685–1750) 视为 “巴洛克时期” 的终结者而忽略拉莫等人在巴赫逝世后维持具有 “巴洛克” 风格的创作也是不合理的。

再者，海顿与莫扎特曾被 19 世纪评论家 E. T. A. Hoffmann 认定为 “浪漫主义” 的先驱，这似乎也无法与 “古典时期的作曲家” 这个称号相互兼容。

“巴洛克风格” 作为统摄这些不同风格的主要审美参照点，因为 它们皆直指巴洛克风格中所共有的动态感与戏剧性两个根本特质。

之后会讲“海顿”，被史学家定义为 “前古典时期”。

数字低音 (*basso continuo*)的使用与“巴洛克时期重叠”

# The End of the Renaissance & the Concept of Baroque

第一首：文艺复兴的弥撒。纯人声，无乐器。Palestrina, *Missa Papae Marcelli* (1562), Dresdner Kammerchor

第二首：标准巴洛克，器乐地位重要 Antonio Vivaldi, "Summer" from *Four Seasons* (1723)

以画为例，《人间欢乐花园》中，最右边的地狱才听器乐曲

According to Manfred Fritz Bukofzer(1910-1955)：*MUSIC in the BAROQUE ERA*.

## Renaissance versus Baroque

| Renaissance                                                  | Baroque                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| One practice, one style（到此时期并非取代教堂风格，只是除了教堂风格的基础上还增加了其他的风格） | Two practices, three styles                                  |
| **Restraint** representation of the text（教会不注重表达歌词，强调乐音和谐好听） | **Afffective, even theatrical** representations of the text（这里隐含了两方面：音乐好听按规则写和歌词会有所冲突） |
| **Equal-voice** polyphony（每个声部都平等出力，标准复调手法） | Treble-bass polarity（高声部忙碌，低声部负责和声）           |
| Diatonic melody in a **small range**（最高音和最低音相距不大） | Diatonic/chromatic melody, **wide range**（最高音和最低音相距甚远） |
| Modal counterpoint（对位法）                                 | Tonal counterpoint (1670s-1680s)（调性）                     |
| Intervallic（横向地写作，追求一行内音高的和谐）              | Chordal（垂直式，先有和弦，再确定音高）                      |
| No pronunced differences of idiom: voices and instruments are largely interchanges（声乐作品和器乐作品可以互换，William Byrd） | Vocal and instrumental idioms are often distinct（不能轻易改编） |

## The Concept of the "Baroque"

Barroco (Portuguese): an irregularly-shaped pearl

作为一个审美概念，要到18世纪。而且最早是用在建筑上的。作为音乐上，是1733年用于侮辱Rameau的歌剧《希波利特和阿里希》( *Hippolyte et Aricie* ）

无论称为什么时期，1600至1750不同音乐体裁之间的风格仍然有共性。

有些学者称为Early Modern Period (secular thoughts and secular art)，文化上从教堂向世俗演变。

还有人称为Orchestral age/Theatrical age，因为管弦乐在其中广泛使用，还常演戏剧，不过没什么人用此说法。

In retrospace (1920s to the present): works of music and art from the "Baroque" period possess the positive attributes of **drama, theatricality, passion** and **extravagance**. 

## Continuo age (the use of Basso continuo, figured bass)

使用数字低音/通奏低音/持续低音的时期。基本用的是harpsichord（羽管键琴）伴奏，同时作曲家往往只写根音，键盘手自己补全所有的和弦。为什么是数字呢？在乐谱中有些非一般三和弦的，会有额外数字标示音程差几度。

Violone, 维奥尔琴，虽然长得像大提琴，但是最多可以有8弦，还有品格。可以和harpsichord合奏。

Lute. （鲁特琴），可以取代羽管键琴

**Basso continuo** is a form of musical accompaniment used in the Baroque period. It means "continuous bass." Basso continuo, sometimes just "continuo", was played by an instrument providing **chordal accompaniment** such as a keyboard instrument ofr plucked string instrument such as the lute along with another bass instrument such as cello, violone, or bassoon. **The keyboard instrument was normally a harpsichord but could also be an organ**, such as a small portative instrument. It was not usual to write out all the nots for the keyboard player. The composer normally just wrote the bass line which would be played by the left hand and indicated what the harmony should be (which chords should be played) by writing figures underneath the music.

例如Vampire Weekend, *Step*; The Beatles, *In My Life*中也有，70’s 有Baroque Pop风潮。

总结：重点是Basso Continuo、figure base、ground base。

## Aesthetic and Technical Connections

为什么当时会喜欢听？当时有雅典学院为了复古，创造了实验音乐（Experimental Music）。

1600年之所以被视为Baroque风格的起点，是大约在1590s左右出现了实验音乐，引领了风潮。这其实比文艺复兴更像文艺复兴，因为它试图直接复原（想像中的）古希腊的音乐。

Girolamo Mei，1519-1594认为古希腊悲剧音乐是单声部。Galilei支持其想法。

~~*Ars perfecta* (Perfect Music)~~，Galilei认为不好听，抛弃对位法(Sensuous adornments of counterpoint)，模仿自然，The Imitation of Nature

但是Galilei他反对~~Madrigalism~~（牧歌主义，指把文字里的内容用歌表达出来，例如Monteverdi, *Zefiro torna*），认为很简单粗暴。

他所模仿的是Human Speech, Natural Language，被称为极端人文主义（radical humanism）。他相信Music is an Art of Persuasion，*Stile rappresentativo* "representation style"（说服的艺术，这也是它相信的音乐的教化和美学作用），一开始仅指模仿人讲话的风格。当然后来很快又变了。

**Monody**（单声歌曲）：a single voice (taking from actual, enacted, enunciated speech accompanied by the lute)

事实上文艺复兴时期以前，也是有一个声音所唱的音乐Monophonic（单音音乐），不过没有乐器，而上面的定义中有伴奏。

对古代戏剧的研究，不能绕过以下这个婚礼。

*Intermedii*: <font color="red">Music perfomed between the acts of a spokeeen comedy</font> "One of the first practical demonstrations, or tests, of the new radical-humanist esthetic came in 1589, when Count Bard was asked to organize the entertainment for the wedding of the Grand Duke Ferdinando de' Medici（斐迪南一世·德·美第奇）of Tuscany to the Princess Christine of Lorraine（洛林的克莉斯汀）."

"<font color="red">Florence, 1589.</font> On the occasion of the rigning Grand Duke Ferdinando de' Medici's（斐迪南一世·德·美第奇）marriage to Christine of Lorraine（洛林的克莉斯汀）. <font color="red">It's one of the fundamental episodes in the theatre of the Ancient regime's history.</font> The perfomance was increasingly becoming an instrument to display the power and technical capacity of the lord and his court. Florence, the capital of the Grand Duchy, anticipated this synthesis of art and power. <font color="red">This period must be considered, due to the inventions and the technological advancements, and its resonance in all the European courts, as the acme of this experimentaion.</font>"

[http://www.artes-exhibition.digital/florence-1589/]

它少见地用了复调的手法，用的单声歌剧，请的牧歌主义的先锋者来表演。

"The *intermedii* became increasingly lavish and costly—a form of conspicuous meant to impress invited guests with their noble host's wealth and liberality. The height was reached at Medici family weddings, each success one striving hard at Medici family weddings, each success one striving hard to outdo the last… <font color="red">The 1589 nupital festivities for Ferdinand were the most lavish of the Medici extravaganzas…</font> The big concerned numbers were mainly the work of the great <font color="red">madrigalists</font>…"

两个人是重要的单声歌曲的改革者。

"Monodic Revolution", "Monodic Revolutionaries"

Giulio Caccini(卡契尼, ca. 1550-1618)，和Jacopo Peri（佩里，1561-1633）



下一首曲子，像人声念经Rappresentatione Recitativo, "prose recitation in singing" (connecting different arias)，这是爱复调的人坚持自己的追求，但融合了单声音乐的特点作出来的。



下面有两首Caccini作的曲子，第二首虽然叫《牧歌》，但非牧歌主义之作，而是人讲话声加伴奏。

1. Airs, strophic form
2. <font color="red">Madrigals (without madrigalism), through-composed form</font>

"There is speech, delivered at something close to **normal speech tempo and restricted to something like normal speech range**, the whole vocal part is confined to an ambitus of a ninth but really an octave since the high notes is reached only once, near the end—an obvious correlation of range with **rhetorical** emphasis."

**用到Basso Continuo的牧歌**，开始扩大影响。传统的复调在此时期继续流行。

"Begining in 1602, then, madrigals existed—and were available for purchase—in two forms. <u>Traditional polyphonic madrigals</u> remained popular; they continued to be published and reprinted until the 1630s. <u>Continuo madrigals</u> like Caccini's, and eventually "concerned" madrigals with instrumental parts, gradually gained on the older type, outstripping it in numbers of new publications in the 1620s."

慢慢，这种来源于婚礼幕间的音乐，走向了戏剧舞台。例如Dialogue

From *Intermedii* to *Arias, recitativo* to *Operas (Musical Tales)*，时代大约在1600年。

少数人不认为这是歌剧，不够丰富，所以后期加了舞台效果，动作等的，才是歌剧。

"The essential 'operatic' move, then, was the insistence that music function on two levels—as <font color="red">**representing music** and also as **representing speech**</font>—which meant that some of the music was coded one way for the characters on stage and another way for the audience. There was a music that both the audience and the stage characters 'heard' as music (the songs and dances) [<font color="red">phenomenal music</font>] and another music that the audience heard as music but that was 'inaudible' to the characters on stage who were represented as speaking. [<font color="red">noumental music</font>]"

# From Monteverdi's Madrigals to Monteverdi's Operas

## Monteverdi's Madrigals

Leo Schrade, *Monteverdi: creator of the modern Music*

Claudio Monteverdi 1567-1643

终其一生，出版了九册的牧歌，可见其热爱。

"By the time Monteverdi composed the *Lagrime d'amante* (*Lover's Tears*), even Monterverdi's polyphonic style had been touched by the monodic stile recitativo."

开始在Mantua(Màntova)，后来因工钱少，搬到威尼斯工作生活。

*Incenerite spoglie* ("Ashen Remains")  *Lagrime d'Amante al sepolcro dell'amata* ("A lover's tears at his beloved's grave", 1610 from the Sixth Book)

第六册中的曲子，体现了A capplla和stile recitativo的融合。在这以后，他不再写纯粹复调+声乐的组合了。

之后他尝试单声歌曲加上实验性效果

1. Unstaged monody
2. Music for staging in the theater of mind

*Lettera Amorosa* ("Love Letter"), is a monody from the Seventh Book (1619), the most extended one that Monteverdi ever conceived outside of an actual theatrical situation.

然后又走向了一定的牧歌主义的实验，比如 *Stile concitato* "agitated sytle".（激动风格）

里面表现了一男一女打架的情景，极具剧场效果。

可见，Monteverdi的风格多样。

接下来是第八本中的《仙女的悲叹》（复调风格）。这里用了下行四音音阶Lament, descending tetrachord (minor mode chaconne bass)，影响至贝多芬等一众人。

Lament是夏空/洽空（Chacona）的其中一种，即他开创了悲叹调的下行四音音阶。等于说在Basso continuo中听到了一种固定重复的低音音型

这相当于作曲家独立发明了一种语言，在他的最后一首歌里面也用了这种技巧。

"By the time of his accession to the post in 1601 [at Mantua] he had already published four books of madrigals and had already been famously attacked by a conservative music theorist name **Giovanni Maria Artusi**（阿图西） for harmonic liberties in madrigals that would eventually be published in his next book (1603). The controversy enhances his reputation enormously, especially when he joined in himself, first in the preface to his **Fifth Book** of Madrigals (1605). Two years later—in <font color="red">1607</font>, the year of *Orfeo*—Monteverdi fully responded to his critics."

> Texts (aesthetic arguments):
>
> 1. Giovanni Artusi, L’Artusi overo /delle imperfettioni della moderna musica (Venice, 1600)
> 2. Claudio Monteverdi, Preface to *Il quinto libro de madrigali a cinque voci* (Venice, 1605)
> 3. Giulio Cesare Monteverdi, “Dichiaratione” [“Declaration”], in Claudio Monteverdi, *Scherzi musicali a tre voci di Claudio si ritrova stampata nel quinto libro de suoi madrigali* (Venice, 1607)

Monteverdi提出了“第二实践”<font color="red">Seconda pratica</font> (the "second practice", *stile moderno*)，相对地，阿图西捍卫的“第一实践”<font color="red">Prima pratica</font> (the "first practice", *stile antico*)。

第二实践：希望文字不要成为音乐的奴隶。例如，为了歌词表达，必须引入一些不和谐的音程。当然，Monteverdi也不反对其他的路线。

| Renaissance                                    | Baroque                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| One practice, one style (church)，只有第一实践 | <font color="green">Two practice in parallel</font> (antico, moderno) three styles (church, chamber ,theater) |

**Word-Painting or “Madrigalisms”**

“… striking musical images, evoking the text almost literally”

1. Sound: breezes, sweet accents, murmuring, sweet sound, music, harmony, sonorous caves
2. Voice: weeping, singing, groaning, sighing, moaning, speaking, debating
3. Image: foot, wace, green leaves, flowers dancing, fields, heads garlanded, mountains and deep valleys, caves, the sun rising at dawn, golden radiance, light, silver, cerulean mantle, abandoned woods, fire of the eyes
4. Action: breezes animate a landscape, young women dance, sound echoes in caves, the sun rises and spreads its light; the speaker wanders alone through abandoned woods
5. Dramatic situation: the speaker is alone and tormented by thoughts of love, desire, and loss, even though the world beyond the abandoned woods is celebrating with song, dance, and a beautiful dawn

*Zefiro torna* *(Summer Breezes return*)

Dance: basso ostinato，固定低音或和弦不斷重複

其中chaconne (It., ciaccona, esp., chacona): lively dance imported into Italy from Latin America

## Monteverdi's Opera

In collaboration with Otravio Rinuccini（里努奇尼)and Jacopo Corsi, **Peri** is best known for composing what was probably the Greast opera (musical tale), *La Dafne* (《达芙妮》, 1598)，and also, in collaboration with Rinuccini, the fust opera for which complete music still exists, L’ Euridice(《尤厨狄著》, 1600)

Some recognize them as **Muscial Tales** rather than **Opera**. 直到1607年Monteverdi写作《奥菲欧》才算。

原因：

Monody: Solo song (often with a tone of lamentation) **Greek monodia**, from **monodia *singing alone***.

Chorus: comments on the action as it unfolds Greek **khoros**.

Dance: Choreographed movement and gesture (ritualistic).

### Monteverdi的写作模式的变化：

Monteverdi's two most famous theatrical pieces, sole survivors in the repertory of the court and market genres of seventeenth-century Italy, will make an ideal vantage point for observing them since they epitomized the two artistic and political poles:

从宫廷写作模式到商业写作模式。

Màntova-> Venice

《奥菲欧》*L’ Orfeo*->《波佩亚的加冕》

有将近40年的跨度。

早期歌剧极尽奢华，展现财力和权力。

"The early musical plays, of which Monteverdis Orfeo was the crowning stroke, are characterized as the capital artistic expression of the twin triumphs of political absolutism and economic mercantilism, an expression that brought to its pinnacle the traditional explorations of the arts 'as a means of representing power.'"

"Display of **splendor** was one of the main social functions of music for the
Counter Reformation and the baroque courts, made possible only through
money; and the more money spent, the more **powerful** was the representation. Consistent with the mercantile ideas of wealth, **sumptuousness** in the arts became actually an end in itself…However, viewed from the social angle theshining lights of the flooring arts cast the blackest of shadows. Hand in hand with the brilliant development of court and church music when the Inquisition and che ruthless exploitation of the lower classes by means of oppressive taxes."

Bukofzer

所以要有

- 多人
- 舞台、器乐、灯光
- 故事要讲宏大的神话，以便贵族们代入。所以体裁多是allegories。
- 不过，此时期还是反对甚至禁止VIRTUOSITY（炫技）的，觉得俗气。所以还是有单声歌曲的感觉。到了大众时期则不然。

1. The fusion of all che arts in the common entrprise of princely aggrandizement. The monster assemblages of singers and instrumentalists were marched, and even exceeded, by che luxuriously claborate stage sets and thearrical machinery.
2. The plots involved mythological or ancient historical heroes caught up in stereotyped conflicts of love and honor, were transparent allegories of the sponsoring rulers, who were address directly, as we know, in the obligatory prologues that linked the story of the opera to the cent of their reign.
3. The ban on virtuosity reflected the old aristocratic prejudice, inherited from Aristotle. (Caccini, moderate, intimate, clegantly applied throat-music called Borgia, comparable in some ways with the intimate style of singing known in the 20th century as crooning).

"In the myth, after losing Eurydice a second time, Orpheus turns against all women, for which reason a rioting chorus of jealous Bacchantes tears him to pieces. In the Orfeo libretto, Orpheus's facher Apollo, the divine musician, translates Orpheus into the heavenly constellation that bears his name, substituting serene apotheosis for bloody caraclysm."

键盘乐器：<font color="red">Toccata</font>，一般是迎接尊贵的人入场，所以声音听起来热闹高昂。

<font color="red">Toccata</font>, a quasi-military fanfare that, according to the published scorc, was to be played chree times from various places around the hall to silence the audience and invest the proceedings with appropriate pomp. The interest in ostentations displays of power that the Counter Reformation church shared with the ‘baroque’ courts' is nicely confumed by Monteverdi's reuse of the *Orfeo* toccata three years later in a very uncustomary way to back up the choral *falsobordone* (choral recitation) for he Invitatory (opening Psalm verse) in his Vespers of 1610 which, we recall, was originally intended for Rome, the Counter Reformation command center.

#### Commercial Music Theater

"In one of the most impressive feats of self-rejuvenation in the history of music, the septuagenarian Monteverdi, bestirred by the institution of public opera cheaters, or else offered teums he couldn't refuse, came out of retirement and composed a final trio of operas for the Teatro SS. Giovanni e Paolo, one of several competitors that quickly sprang up to challenge San Cassiano, the original opera house".


1643年，为庆祝歌剧院的落成，他又写了一部《波佩亚的加冕》。其内容变为

Historical Fantasy，历史演义

"For the grater enjoyment of the paying public" Poppea: celebrating vice triumph and mocking virtue.

剧情是邪恶最终战胜，好人被放逐。

"Noro, enamored of Poppaca, who was the wife of Otho, sent the latter, under the pretext of embassy, to Lusitania (Portugal], so that he could take his pleasure with her--this according to Cornelius Tacitus. ..Otho, desperate at seeing himself deprived of Poppaca, gives himself over to frenzy and exclamations. Octavia, wife of Nero, orders Otho to kill Poppaca. Otho promises to do it; but lacking the spirit to deprive his adored Poppaca of life, he dresses in the clothes of Drusilla, who was in love with him. Thus disguised, he enters the garden of Poppaca. Loe [the god Eros] disturbs and prevents that death. Nero repudiates Octavia, in spite of the counsel of [the philosopher] Seneca, and takes Poppaca to wife. Seneca is sentenced to death, and Octavia is expelled from Rome."

这里也用了Lament的下行四音阶，但用了大调，表现了他们爱情的明朗（和建立在他人的痛苦之上）和不顾道德的转换。

这里可以解释为：Lubricious major replaces the lamenting minor -> Subverting all moral and political codes

从此开始流行返始咏叹调：

### 返始咏叹调 (de capo aria, A B A 型)

唱完A、B段后回到A段。
> A: I gaze on you, I enjoy you.
> I hug you, I entwine you. No more pain, no more death.
> O my life, O my treasure.
>
> B: I am yours. I am yours,
> My joy, say you lose me too.
> You are truly my idol.
> Yes, my love, yes my heart, my life, yes.
>
> A: I gaze on you, I enjoy you.
> I hug you, I entwine you. No more pain, no more death.
> O my life, O my treasure.

Comic Scene
"Octavia's farewell to Rome as she boards the ship that is to take her into
exile, is followed immediarely by the most farcical—Arnalta's gloating at
her mistress's impending elevation, and her own."

1. 美声
2. 喜剧

学界认为，自从歌剧开始卖票、开始商业化之日，正是真正的歌剧出现之时。

"Not surprisingly, **virtuosity** found a natural home in the commercial music cheater. It is only one of the reasons for regarding the Venctian Teatro San Cassiano and the year of 1637, not the Florentine Palazzo Patti or the year 1597, as the true time and place of the birth of opcra as we know it now… From now on, the word opera will mean the commercial opera."

Seventeenth and eighteenth century serious opera is unthinkable without *castrati*（去势男高音、阉人歌手），才能唱出高声。

**Castrato** (plural: castrati)

提问：第一实践？巴洛克初期音乐风格？巴洛克中期音乐风格？

分别是

1. 文字屈服于音乐性，禁止引入不和谐音程。
2. 初期有了单声歌曲，模仿人声，但排斥牧歌主义。此时Basso continuo开始广泛使用。
3. 中期，第二实践为人们所接受，加之Monteverdi开创了Lament等，以及向歌剧开始演变，例如有了丰富的舞台效果。
4. （但是，传统的复调音乐并不是不存在了，在整个时期仍然有人在写作。）

# France Opera

The Spectacle of Power and Pleasure

Jean-Basptiste Lully and the *Tragédie en musique*（音乐悲剧）/*Tradédie lyrique*（抒情悲剧）

得易于路易十四推行的“法式大餐”的奢华风格。

Louis XIV

- Born in 1638, died in 1715
- Actively reigned from 1661 to 1715, although he became king in 1643, at nearly five years of age 
- Centrallized power through his court at Versailles, fashioned himself as an absolute monarchy
- Supported by the arms, including theater and opera, as entertainment and as a symbolic representation of his power.

Absolute Monarchy：君主专制

把自己称为“太阳王”，强调自己的神授的权力。

法国歌剧相比意大利克制，注重阶级和权威。

# The spectable of Power and Pleasure

Jean-Baptiste Lully and the *Tragédié en musique*（音乐悲剧）

*Tragédié lyrique*（抒情悲剧）

以下要讲的是法国的歌剧。因为要和意大利区分，所以命名上不一样。

Jean-Baptiste Lully（1632-1687），吕利，一开始担任意大利语私人家教。

后来进入了宫廷，和Louis XIV

**Dance and Political Control**:
"Dance reinforced the state by offering a model of discipline, order, refinement, restraint, and subordination of the individual to a common enterprise. Requiring aristocrats to participate in social dancing and in ballet performances kept them busy and provided a ritualized demonstration of social hierarchy, with the king at the top. It is no wonder that French Baroque Music, so centered on dance, is marked by refinement, elegance, and restraint, in strong contrast to the individuality and showmanship typical of Italian music at the time."

"Nowhere else in Europe had operas become classics, nor had any other composer of operas been exalted into a symbol not only of royal taste but of royal authority as well. **Authority** is what French music was all about, and Lully's operas above all. They were the courtiest court operas that ever were.

Lully, *Cadmus et Hermione*, 1673，旋律风格朴实克制，旋律向上。对比意大利歌剧，后者多飙高音，强调美声唱法。

## Political Debate

想要引入意大利歌剧时，有人为了维护法国文化的品味，强调区别。

French v.s Italian

| French      | Italian  |
| ----------- | -------- |
| Reason      | Pleasure |
| rules、克制 | 旋律大跳 |
|             |          |

Raguenet在1702年写了书，比较两种歌剧的异同。
Freach musicians believe themselves lost if they do the slightest thing contrary to the **rules**. They caress, tickle, respect the car and still [they] tremble with fear that they will not succeed even afer having done things as correctly as possible. **The Italians, more bold, suddenly change** the note and the mode and make double and redoubled trills of a 7 and 9 measures upon notes which we would not even believe suitable for the slightest trill. They hold notes of such a prodigious length that those who are not accustomed to them, first of all cannot help being offended by such boldness which subsequently they cannot seem to praise cough. They make such lengthy **melismas** that those hearing them for the first time become confused. (Raguenet 1702)

If one gives one of these dissonances to a Frenchman to sing, he will never have the force to sustain it fimly which [is what] it needs to make it successful. **His car being accustomed to the sweetest and the most natural consonances** is shocked by the irregularity. He trembles when singing it; he wavers. Whereas, the Italians whose cars are experienced since childhood with these dissonances and were therefore used to them by force of habit, are as firm on the most irregular note as on the world's loveliest chord and sing them all with a boldness and assurance which makes them always succced. (Raguenet, 1702)

## 歌剧在法国的发展

"Opera had a difficult time getting started in France. Like their English counterparts, who also possessed a glorious tradition of <font color="red">spoken theater (话剧)</font>, the aristocrats of seventeenth-century France sawr only a child's babble in what the Italians called drama per musica (drama 'through' or 'by means of' music). To their minds, <u>the art of music and the art of drama simply would not mix</u>. Artists and critics who value lintellectual understanding have always resisted opera.

一开始，认为削减了严肃性，面临强烈的反抗。

比如Jean Racine(让·拉辛，1639-1699)《费德尔》 1677，是传统的话剧，完全不适合改编成歌剧，所以有所冲撞。

在路易十四执政前，法国宫廷内部已经有模仿Orfeo产生的歌剧。也带有下行低音。

接下来，正式的法语歌剧出现。

Robert Cambert（康贝尔）、Pierre Perrin（佩兰, ca. 1620-1675）写作了Pomona（《波蒙纳》），1671，早在Lully前写出的。所以让他很不高兴。

意大利强调的华丽，在法国歌剧里有过之而无不及，希望把所有人吸入里面无法自拔。

"'The Italian spectacles... bedizened the French court more gloriously than any rationalistic drama could do, for the purpose of such spectacles.is to hold the mind, the eye and the ear equally in thrall.

小结：

On the one hand:

"Like every other aspect of French administrative culture, the French court opera was wholly centralized. Its primary purpose was to furnish propaganda' for the state and for the divine right of the king, and only secondarily to provide entertainment for the nobility and bourgeoisie. No operatic spectacle could be shown in public anywhere in France that had not been prescreened, and approved, at court."

## Dramaturgy（戏剧构作）

最后一部（成熟的风格）
*Rinaldo and Armida* by Nicolas Poussin, 1628

When Lull's patron was exiled in 1652, Lulli secured release from her employ and found work as a servant to Louis XIV's cousin, Anne-Marie-Louise d'Orleans and as a dance and mime at the royal court, where he danced alongside, and made friends with, the teenaged king. Upon the death of his violin teacher the next year, Lulli assumed the man's position as court composer of ballroom music. In 1669, Jean-Baptiste Lully was naturalized and managed to finagle the rights to manage it from its originally designated patent holder (Pierre Perrin, 1620-1675). From then on he was a **musical Sun King**, the absolute autocrat of French music, which he re-created in his own image.

Lully把Perrin创作歌剧的专利拿到，开始一发不可收拾地创作，被称为“音乐上的太阳王”。

Jean-Basptiste Moliére（莫里哀，1622-1673）French comic playwright，以前和Lully合作，但后来被其打压话剧创作

The Paris Opera is the primary opera and ballet company of France. It was founded in 1669 by Louis XIV (through Pierre Perrin) as the Académie d'Opéra,
and shortly thereafter wns placed under the leadership of Jean-Baptiste Lully and officially renamed the Académie Royale de Musique, but continued to be
known more simply as the Opéra. 

相当于重塑了法兰西对于歌剧的民族认同

Lully's style did not merely define an art from,it defineda national identity. The monumental mythological or heroic-historical plots, some chosen by the king himself. Celebrated the implacable universal order and the supremacy of divine or divinely appointed rulers.

Lully和Quinault合作*Alceste*, 1674，在宫廷中演出

在此之际，法国歌剧也形成了一套程序。

French Overture（invented by Camber）"a universal code for pump"，法国序曲

（回想：之前也有Toccata曲）

## French Overture

- 第一段较慢dotted rhythms and rapid note to strong beats（4/4拍中，插入有附点的音乐，容易听出来。有的时候还会按此风格自由演出乐谱上没有的部分）（**A**）
- 第二段稍快quick and contrapuntal，用到对位法（B）
- 第三段像第一段，但是弱一点（A）
- (**A**)×2, (BA)×2
- **A A** B A B A

（这一点又返回影响了意大利歌剧）

J.S. Bach也写过French Overture from BWV 831，只不过他把附点中间的停顿用其他的音符填满。

开局还要有一段开场白讲话，感谢国王

"What the overture served to introduce was an obligatory panegysic prologue （开场自）of a full act's duration, vastly outstripping its Italian courtly prototype."

## Dance

例如*Atys*., Prologue中，必要的就是大量的舞蹈，（国王的歌剧）

*Chaconne* or *passacaglia*

这两个有些难区分。

Passacaille，里面有数字低音，有Chaconne，羽管键琴伴奏。

"'The contemporary allegorical relevance of the plot, proclaimed at the first in the prologue and affirmed at the last by the passacaglia (Armide], was what really counted in a tragédie lyrique. The whole drama was conceived as a sublimated court ritual. Royal and noble spectators did not seek transcendence of contemporary reality but rather its cosmic [mythical and heroic] confirmation. They did not value the kind of verisimilitude that makes the imaginary seems real. They wanted just the opposite: to see the real-that is, themselves, projected into the domain of fable and archetype."

Opera: *tragédie en musique* (summary)

- Created by Jean-Baptiste Lully and Philippe Quinault in 1673, with *Cadmus sa Hermione*; their final completed operas, *Armide*, premiered in 1686
- Form of musical tragedy that combines music, poetry, dance, and spectacle
- Mythological subject matter (gods aand larger-than life heros), with stage machinery creating spectacle
- The use of ***recitative*** makes continuous musical drama possible
- The distinction of ***recitative*** and ***air*** expressesthe distinction between dialogue and lyrical expression

**法国不叫aria，叫air**

Three Scenes from Cadmus et Hermione

- Act 2, scene 4: Cadmus and Hermione say farewell to each other as Cadmus prepares to fight a dragon: **lyrical dialogue**
- Act 2, scene 5: After Cadmus departs, Hermione is left alone to lament her fare as a suffering lover, directly addressing Cupid (*Amour*): monologue
- Act 2, scene 6: Cupid descends from the heavens to comfort Hermione:
    **divertissement**, combining solo song and dance (animated golden statues)

The goddess Cybèle(西布莉)has fallen in love with a mortal man, Atys, and she raises him to the position of high priest in the cult of her worshipers. Atys, however, is in love with Sangaride(桑佳丽德)，who loves him in turn, although she is to be wedded to the king, Célenus. Enraged and jealous, Cybèle causes Atys to lose his senses and murder Sangaride (hallucinating that she is a monster); once he returns to his senses, he commits suicide as an act of revenge against Cybèle. Grieving, Cybèle transforms Atys into a pine tree as an eternal symbol of love.

法国歌剧偶尔会有一点颤音shine，作修饰。

Lully控制他的作品，不允许演唱家自主发挥。

"Lully is ranting at everybody. Everyone wants to shine in *Atys*, and there
is no way to shine in this work of Lully's. **Everything is fashioned, calculated, measured** so that the action of the drama progresses without ever slackening. This singer takes it upon himself to add ornaments, showing down the beat; and in order to remain on stage longer and arouse a little more applause, drags out an air that Lully intended to be simple. short and natural. The danger begs for a futile repetition; the violin want to play when Lully asks for flutes. Everybody seeks his own reflection in *Abys*. **Lully has to defend his work**."

# The Baroque Keyboard Tradition

- 管风琴（Pipe Organ）
- 羽管键琴（Harpsichord），可以定做不同flavor，如法国、意大利和德国
- 楔槌键琴/古钢琴（Clavichord），late 16th or 17th century

## Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment

Jean Rondeau：当红法国harpsichord演奏家

Jean Rondeau records "Vertigo" for harpsichord (Joseph-Nicolas-Pancrace Royer, 1703-1755)

羽管键琴（Harpsichord）的发声原理是勾弦发声，所以弹奏者的手应该轻一些。这与弹钢琴的手感完全不一样。

"The stock of the instrument medium rose in consequence to the point where a major composer could be concerned primarily with music for instruments. Before the seventeenth century that had never happened."

Girolamo Frescobaldi (1583-1643)

在Saint Peter's Church, 一直工作到退休

> Frescobaldi was at once the most **"flamboyantly"** impressive keyboard composer of his time and the most characteristic, because it was characteristic of early seventeenth-century music to be **Flamboyantly impressive.**

## Instrumental Music in the Renaissance

其实地位并不怎样，最多做一个声部的伴奏。

- Based on vocal models
- <font color="red">Intabulation</font>，在吉他中意味着插值、在空隙内插入一些旋律
    from the Italian word *intavolatura*, refers to an <u>arrangement</u> of a vocal or ensemble piece for keyboard, **lute**, or other **plucked string instrument**, written in **tablature**（指谱法），在文艺复兴时期意味着改编。
    Example: Luis de Narvász (fl. 1526-49), *Cancion Mille regres* (ca. 1538)
- Variations *or* Variation Form
    Example: William Byrd, *Pavana Lanchryme*, based on *Flow, my tears* (John Dowland)

Abstract intrumental music

- <font color="red">Prelude, fantasia, ricercate</font>（赋格曲的前身）, <font color="red">toccata</font>
- <font color="red"><u>Ricercate</u></font> *or* ricercar: multi-sectional and imitative
- Cazona *or* <u>canzon</u>: contrapuntal, fast, originating as intabulations of French chansons

Frescobaldi的器乐更加知名。他有两种写法，其中第二种不凸显对位法的更适合当今的钢琴。

> Frescobaldi published sixteen volumes between 1608-1637. Of the sixteenth, only four volumes contatined vocal compositions (madrigals and continuo arias). The remaining twelve were devoted to instrumental works.

> The *libri d'intavolatura* contained Frescobaldi's most novel, most **theatrical**, and most elaborately "**open-ended**" compositions, and in that sense they reflected his most vividly over-the-top (i.e. "baroque") side.

在评价（Rome 1637）中，提到了以下几个概念：

<font color="red">Toccate</font> d'intavolatura di cembalo et organo, partite di diverse arie, e correnti, balleti, <font color="red">ciaccone</font>, <font color="red">passacagli</font> (Rome 1637)

Partite: variations over a ground bass, 简单理解为变奏曲，在低音部分变奏，重复循环低音型。

toccate: formally capricious and unpredictable, 与上面相反，不做重复，变化多端，不可预测。

## partite

Ciaccona (chacona)

A fair and furious dance in syncopated triple setter. As a dance, the *ciaccona* [improvisatory] was built over repetitive chord progressions. It was considered so inverterately lascivious that it was banished from the Spanish stage.（因为有强烈的性暗示而被禁止）

> Monteverdi published his setting of Ottavio Rinuccini's imitation of Petrarch's famous sonnet *Zefro torna* ("The breeze returns") in the form of a 'ciacona', and from then on it was a major Italian for **love poetry**, for **stage music**, and for **instrumental virtuosity**.

J.S. Bach的Violin Partita No. 2 in D minor, BWV 1004, ca. 1720: V. Ciaccona (Hilary John)中，运用了如下循环：D-C#-D-Bb-G-A-D

知名的“100次变奏”：Girolamo Frescobaldi, *Cento Partite sopra Passacagli* ("A Hundred Variations on Passacalles",1637)

红圈到蓝圈变奏，从Re到La

区别：Chaconne和Passacaglia（其实很细微）

> *Passacagli* is Italian for *passacalles*, a related Spanish genre consisting of variations on cadential patterns that apparently grew out of the habits of guitarists who accompanied courtly singers, and who introduced and bestrewed the songs with casual ritornellos-the kind of thing accompanists in today's nonliterate ("pop") genres call "vamping". Like today's popular guitarists and keyboardists, who often take off on their vamping figures for impressive flights of fancy, so the players of *passacagli* often elaborated them into long instrumental interludes, eventually into independent instrumental showpieces.

> The repetitive cadential phrases of the *ciaccona* and the *passacagli* were a natural for adaptation to traditional ground-bass techniques, and that is how they entered the domain of written music.

成就：把chaconn写下来，不需要即兴。分别创造了两套，

> The first literate <font color="red">instrumental adaptations</font> of the *ciaccona* and *passacagli* were by Frescobaldi. His second *libro d'intavolatura*, published in 1627, contained both a set of *Partite sopra ciaccona* ("variations on the chacona") and one *Partite sopra passacagli* (" variations on passacalles")

总结：

> Frescobaldi's fanciful mixture of sameness and contrast gave instrumental music access to a while new temporal plane, and a new **dramatized** character. This was music with real "content", not just an accessory to vocal performances or a liturgical time-filler.

有学者认为两者挺混乱。虽说求同存异，但是像A mixed bag…

> *Cento Partite sopra Passacagli*: "A Mixed Bag /Compendium of Variations on Passacaglias"

虽然刚刚是Re到La，但百变奏曲中也有Fa到Do的变奏，且结尾处处理得也和开头不同。

> The lack of 'tonal unity' has led some writers to suggest that the work is no 'composition' at all, but just an assortment of goods. Other writers have even suggested that the components were printed, in the **wrong order** as the result of 'some sort of misha at the printer's office.'

## toccate（托卡塔，触技曲）

formally capricious and unpredictable

有点像弹琴开头的调音，后来独立成乐章。

> "The lack of tonal unity has led some writers to suggest that the work is no "composition'"at all, but just an assortment of goods. Other writers have even suggested that the components were printed, in the wrong order as the result of "some sort of mishap at the printer's office."

因为不依赖于特定的音型，且没有重复，所以对于作曲家的要求很高。

> "Although Frescobaldi's printed works give sufficient evidence of his skill, still, to get a true idea of his deep knowledge, one must hear him  <font color="red">improvise</font> toccatas full of admirable refinements and inventions." (André Maugars)

在进行的过程中，经常更换主题。例如Toccata for harpsichord. Toccata No. 3, ca. 1615, revised in 1637

### Toccata: definition

- <u>multi-sectional organizaition</u> in improvisatory style, introducing and "developing" distinctive gestures and figures; spontaneous and unpredictable (*toccata* = "<font color="red">touched</font>" as in exploring the keys and tuning of the instrument, often introducing another piece)
- 多段体、即兴风格、前导性。

注意：ricercar后来独立出去了。

> The earliest recorded use of the word "toccata" in a musical source occurs in a lute collection of 1536, where it refers to the kind of brief **improvisatory prelude** formerly called <font color="red">*preambulum*</font> or <font color="red">*ricercar*</font> or even *taster de corde* ("checking to see if the strings are in tune"). The new term was evidently coined to sabstiture for "ricercar" when the later term had become firmly associated with "strict" imitative compositions.

重点：触技曲，只有Franscobaldi，且说可以止于随性之处，可以自己选择性弹其中的一段。

> Later on, pieces called 'toccata achieved greater dimensions and independent status, but they always remained "free" and open in form, deriving their continuity from discontinuity, to put it paradoxically, That is, **they relied on contrast**—in <font color="red">texture, meter, tempo, tonality</font>—between short striking sections, rather than the continuous development of motives, to sustain interest. "Striking" meant virtuosic as well; toccatas, like the preluding improvisations of old, were often **festive display** pieces that turned the very act of laving into **a form of theater.**
>
> In the toccatas, I have taken care not only that they be abundantly provided with different passages and affections but also that each one of the said passages can be **played separately**, <u>the performer is thus under no obligation to finish them all but can end where he thinks best.</u> (Frescobaldi)

## Organ Mass

Franscobaldi曾出版《音乐之花》1635

其中第一段是前奏toccata。

*Toccate di durezze e ligature/toccata chromatica in Fiori musicali* ("Musical Flowers" 1635)
(toccatas with dissonances and suspensions)

Toccatas accompanying the church service: Organ Masses
